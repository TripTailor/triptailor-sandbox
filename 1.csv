1,"Perfect location and a perfect spot for the budget traveller :)"
2,"really neat spot, the stairs will seem like nothing in a day or two"

-1,"The dorm kind of doubles as the common pre drinks party area which is fine I had no trouble sleeping either night"
-1,"I think that might be a sign how tired I was."
2,"generally anywhere with a bed and a shower free WiFi is great."
3,"I really enjoyed my time in this hostel"
-1,"We stayed in the 20-bed room."
-1,"Others in the room were decently respectful of others' sleep."
2,"The showers were very nice, the toilets smelled a bit,"

2,"Everything was great, if you don't mind a stray bug, and climbing 5 sorries on small round steps."

-1,"nothing was said."
-1,"Also the light was out by our corner so I could never see anything."
-1,"We basically tried to spend as much time as possible out of the hostel."

1,"it there were actually 12 beds in there."
-1,"The beds were somewhat uncomfy and it was quite cold during the night,"
1,"we didn't mind."
2,"Just bring warm pyjamas :) Also taking your own towel with you might be a good idea, because the provided towel can be very small (some of them were bigger than the others)."

-1,"the hostel was clean and the room we were in (all-girls room) was great, loft-like and had a fridge and a microwave for out own food."
-1,"only problem was that the shower was in the same room as the sinks so when someone was showering we didn't dare go get water etc. and there was no sink in the toilet."

-1,"El sitio parecia un local de fiesta que lo habian convertido en hostal, y con esto me refiero a que solo había un espacio común donde estaba el dueño y un sofa."
-1,"  Las habitaciones eran dos cuartos enormes y por lo menos en el que a mí me tocó la pared que daba a la calle era una puerta de madera con una cristalera enorme tapada con una manta, podeis imaginaros el frio que hacía, por si eso fuera poco no teniamos nórdicos, solo una simple manta para taparnos y la sábana de la almohada no las cambiab"

-1,"No common room to mix n mingle with the rest."

1,"they weren´t friendly at all..."
2,"I loved this hostel."

-1,"Lacks a common area and a kitchen properly... that is not IN the bathroom."

-1,"NiCe =)) Very friendly staff at the hotel."
2,"Excellent location."
-1,"The only thing that I didn't like were the showers."
-2,"Staff not very polite, atmosphere of the hostel cold,people don't speak to others maybe caused by the poor places (2 big room of 20 beds,1 bath room without door, just some WC and showers about 5 of each), I feel myself there like spending time in a train station hall.In bath better wearing shower shoes."
-1,"In bed, sleep with my clothes due to a bed feeling from the cleanliness of it...Sunday morning, staff open room door & lights at 9, sorry for people who wants to sleep...Near station,red light"

2,"Besides that I recommend the hostel!!"
2,"Very good"
2,"Passed through this hostel a few times before, always found it a good place to stay, beds were very clean and fresh and showers are good also, discovered they had an upstairs part of the hostel this time which was smaller than the main part of the building, you'll also notice there are these massive beams which appear to take the weight of the structure of the buildings it's possible these are the same as when they were originally constructed back in 1630."
2,"Nice place, Would recommend."
2,"Overall a good place to stay.... Clean and safe."
2,"Good location and the bar nextdoor is cool Staff were not overly friendly"

2,"it´s very good located and fair price."
2,"The hostel was good"
-1,"it was really expensive considering it was quite old."
1,"The booking requirement for minimum of 3 nights even"
-1,"I stayed only 2 nights was unfair."
-1,"Hence I had to pay for extra night which made no sense."
2,"Very good hostel for the price."
2,"Clean and I loved the individual beds."
-1,"Never felt worried for my stuff."
-1," The only thing it may be improved is to have a door in the showers so people can sleep without being bother with the noise."

2,"We had a really nice time here!"
-1,"We stayed in a 10 bed girls doorm."
-1,"Big room, no bunkbeds."
-1,"Unfortunately they put two extra girls in there over the weekend so we were 12 girls, sharing only one Bathroom."
-1,"There's no extra bathrooms in the building, unless you go to the reception area."
-1," Other than that it was okay, only five minutes from central station and walking distance to pubs etc. Would come back."
-1,"I stayed in the female dorm which is quite spacey and the beds are comfortable (you also have a small kitchen with a kettle and a microwave oven here)."
-1,", it´s kinda separated from the hostel and lack any atmosphere - no common room, the only time I have seen the staff was during check in and check out."
-1,"I also have a feeling that the room was not cleaned during my stay (3 nights)."
-1,"We even have to remove sheets from our beds when we were leaving which is something I think the staff should do."
1,"Few toilets for so many people."
2," Not so well located as I thought."

2,"we stayed in 20 mixed dorm first night which was great, the rest two nights we have been moved to female dorms which was just amazing!location-couldn't be better, staff-friendly, helpful, overall: I shall see you very soon!"
2,"This was one of the cheapest hostels in Amsterdam and I was definitely happy to choose it - overall it was a good experience."
-1,"The room (in the building next door) was spacious and comfortable, there's not a lot of privacy when getting in and out of the shower"
1,"(due to shared sink area and outlook into the room)"
1,"it seemed to work anyway."
-1,"Good facilities in room - fridge/freezer, microwave, dishes, lockers etc and towel was included."

2,"You wont find something like that for the price!"
2,"hope to see you soon!"
-1,"4 flights of stairs up to the room wasn't ideal with a suitcase."
-1,"The room was so full they put mattresses of the floor for extra guests so there was 12 in and 10 person room."
2,"Very hot and stuffy in the room."
-1,"If u just want some where to sleep it will do"
-1,"not worth staying there if u want comfort or good atmosphere..."
-1,"The hostel is near the central station as well as the red light district and other popular spots."
2,"This is the best thing about it."
2,"The staff is nice and they have discount cards to some establishments."
-1,"The only downsides are 1."
-2,"There's no lift, and we stayed at the topmost floor, so lugging around our stuff was quite tiring."
1,"2."
1,"The wifi fluctuated."
-1,"The signal is not strong in the room; even in the common room it's pretty weak."
-1,"i spent a long weekend in amsterdam by myself and was very satisfied with aivengo!"

1,"i slept in a dorm with 9 other girls on the 3rd or 4th floor next door to the actual hostel."
1,"there was one bathroom for us,"
2,"it sufficed and was cleaned every day."
-1,"my bed was comfortable and there were enough sockets for everyone."
1,"i received a locker against a 10€ deposit payment (reimbursed upon departure)."
-1,"the stove is not in use due to safety reasons."
1,"Nice little twinroom at the top floor."
-1," The stairs are pretty doable (it's 6 floors"
-1,"it won't kill you UNLESS you travel with lots of luggage)."
-2," Bathroom cleaned, linen ok (you'll get bathtowels for free at private rooms), just don't expect for a high quality mattress!"
2,"Nice view from the shared kitchen."
2," Really great location, safe for solo travelers , and easy to get to."
-1,"Staff was ok (not the smiliest people in the world),"
1,"they'll provide you whatever info you ask and a city map."
-1,"Not a bad place, to stay a night or two."
1,"Could replace the blankets with something warmer."
2,"The guy at reception was really friendly and helpful."
2,"Location is excellent... :)"
1,", the stay would have much better if it has a good mattress, a blanket with cover and of course some extra socket plugs."
-1,"There were just two socket plugs for 20 people and you can imagine how late night you need to stay just to charge your mobile/laptop."
1,":("
2,"The hostel is very well located, the staff is friendly and helpfull."
-1," The only inconvenient is that there is no elevator and the are too many floor with rooms."
-1,"I had to go up to the 5th floor with may baggage and it wasn't easy."
-1,"Location: the hostel is 5 minutes walking from the central station + you can reach all main attractions by walking."
2," Staff: The girl at check-in was kind and nice."
-1,"the guy at check out was very rude + we couldn't leave our luggage as promised We booked a 4-beds room with private bathroom, that was not in the same building ("
1,"very close to it though)"
-1," The room was very basic furnished (2 bunk beds, a dirty sofa) at ground floor, no windows, and a tiny washbasin."
2,"was very nice..."
3,"This is my favorite hostel."
-1,"Wifi is fast (versus non-existent you would find elsewhere), it's a short walk from train station, the main sales point for me was the quality of people are far superior than what you will find elsewhere irregardless of price in this town."
1,"very average hostel"
2,"for a reasonable price."
-1,"need to bring a blanket as what they provide is a very thin fleece blanket that isn't long enough to cover taller person's feet."
2,"Good location and cheap so was happy with the hostel and would go back."
1,"in the rooms there wasn't 6 beds"
1,"8!!!"
-1,"one of this was on the floor and it was too dirty!!"
-2,"Literally just a bed/shower and toilet in the city (no kitchen, no common room) very disappointing."
1,"That said"
2,"very clean nice big rooms ("
-1,"lack of power points in the place)."
-1,"There is also a curfew which would have been nice to know so don't have many late nights."
2,"good location"
1,"there are better hostels out there."
-1,"A pretty basic hostel, an inexpensive no frills place to sleep in a good location."
-1,"Easy to get to from the main train station, and then easy to get from here to all of the action."
-1,"Absolutely no common room to meet people, and the people in the dorms don't seem like they're there to meet fellow travelers."
2,"If you're already with a group of friends and don't need to meet people, its a pretty good option considering its affordability and quality of cleanliness/facilities."
-1,"Easily the worst hostel I have stayed at in 4 months of European travel."
-1,"It is rather cheap for Amsterdam,"
-1,"the 20 bed dorm legitimately looked like hospital ward, there was no kitchen and no common area whatsoever."
-1,"Staff also allowed 2 guys in who grabbed a group of peoples phones that were on charge and then stole them."
-1,"The only place to hang out was in the hospital dorm or hallway."
-2,"Extremely disappointing, kinda ruined my time in Amsterdam."
2,"we had the double room - private bathroom and it was amazing."
-1,"this made us forget the fact that the room was not ready at 12am."
2,"Overall it's an okay place, the staff are kind and they maintain it well."
2,"Showers are warm, lots of washrooms."
-2,"  I felt the lack of a kitchen was a big drawback (there is only a microwave and a bar fridge) and also a lack of common space - there aren't really any good areas to just hang out with people."
-1,"Also sleeping in a 20 bed dorm is quite the experience - bring your earplugs!"
-1,"And they don't have anywhere to store luggage."
2,"  In the end, location is fantastic"
2,", and price is right."
3,"I really enjoyed my staying in Aivengo hostel."
-1,"It almost became my home for this 2 weeks) When I return to Amsterdam, I would like to stay there again."
-1,"i do not recommend booking this hostel."
1," 1."
-1,"they wrote,their free wifi will work in all their rooms - no, it didn´t work!"
1," 2."
-1,"there is no privacy."
-1,"no door in the bathroom,so that all the rest 9 girls in your room watch you drying yourself with a towel,or you must do it in a 1x1m shower cabin, cleaning the walls with your towel."
1," 3."
-1,"the staircase up is horrible especially if you have a suitcase."
1," 4."
-1,"a man-worker was walking through our room every day 2 times without nocking."
-1," 5."
-1,"not 35e worth!"
2,"A very friendly crew...plus the location is perfect near by Ams central/main station"
-2,"The staff is very unfriendly, you have to pay for towels,housekeeping was poor, the bathrooms are tiny and if you´re cold at the night you can´t ask for another extra blanket because the manager doesn´t feel like doing it."
1,"If you only want to stay a few days in the city it´s ok"
1,"if you´re thinking to stay more than three days isn´t worth it."
-1,"The lockers in the room are unsafe, two of my room mates lost cash and one room mate lost her credit card on the first day I arrive."
1,"Too many people able to access the rooms, other than the ten ladies staying in it."
-1,"No sense of security."
-1,"Toilet seats with lids would be nice, a staff member could have been friendlier, some warmer blankets could have helped."
1,"Lacked atmosphere."
-1,"Only complaint is bathroom: 1 bathroom, 12 bed female dorm is shocking."
-1,"Needs separate shower area from sink/toilet so more than one person can use at one time."
1,"Shower was also EXTREMELY dirty."
-1,"Soap/dirt build up around bottom of tub made me cringe."
-1,"Guy came every morning to change the garbage & barely mop down the floor (basically soak up water), why couldn't he wash the tub?"
1,"Took 3 days to replace handsoap."
1,"Had to ask for top bed sheet (not provided)."
2,"Decent price, good location, nice staff!"
-1,"The place was located in a good place, about 5-10 mins walk to AMS central station and 15-20 minutes away from the red light district and 30 mins walk to Vondelpark, 15 mins to Westergasterras."
2,"I liked the place"
1,"the lobby was really small....was hoping to interact with other backpackers"
-1,"was cooped in the room instead."
-1,"My bed was great, all beds were individuals, no bunk beds."
2,"There's a cute balcony (really french doors) and you can look out on Spuistraat."
2,"Thanks for the great time."
-1,"The Hostel was a real nightmare."
-1,"We spent 3 nights in a 10-Femal-Dorm."
-1,"there have been 11 beds in the room and just one bathroom."
-1,"The sheets were dirty and the beds were old, squeaky and uncomfortable."
-1,"The whole place was dirty (especially the bathroom) and the staff seemed to be drunk and confused."
2,"Only the location was excellent."
-1,"It's located right in the middle of Amsterdam, only 5 min away from the train station."
2,"still I would never recommend this hostel to anyone."
1,"I dont how how its possible to this place be acceptable as a ''youth hostel''."
1,"."
-1,"The place is not cleaned enough.Toilets are a bit old."
1,"."
-1,"Also there is no toilet seats in the toilet.yes!"
1,"."
-2,"The mattress is thin than a paper so I was on the top of a bunk bed and the bed bar hit my back, thats ridiculous."
1,"you wont be able to sleep in this hostel."
-1,"there are no facilities at all."
1,"."
-1,"thumbs up for the location"
1,"Only one bathroom ( wc inside!!)"
1,"for a "10 beds" room."
-1," We were not sure that they clean the bathroom and room every day."
-1," the staff was just 'correct'."
-1,"Well the staff is no te very nice, they just don't care, the rooms are good"
1,"they need to have lights for each bed not one for the entire room, the wc is unbelievable small !!"
1,"and they need calefaction or better mantles."

2,"it is a good value for money."
-1,"Had an awesome time here."
2,"Staff were great."
2,"Beds were fine."

-1,"It was much more then what i expected for my money, clean, good, helpful staff and we were lucky that we were with nice people, even if we had our own double room :) Location right next to train station, 7 min walk from food plaza, bars everywhere."
1,"Perhaps a lot of stairs,"
-1,"heck, it is Amsterdam :) A lot of gay bars all down the street,"
1,"not sure if that was because of Pride some time before :P I loved the place, and will definately come back there again :D"

1,"Don't leave stuff in the fridge"
2,"cause people will take it!"
1,"Thanks again :) Cat."
-2,"A very plain hostel, cheap and close to the city."
1,"You get what you pay for so its a fair deal."
2,"Luxury seekers definitely shouldnt go there."
1,"Who just needs a convenient place to stay will be fine."
-1,"the true problem of this hostel is the space because there too many beds in small rooms and the bathroom is a bit ridicolous, the best thing is the location"
-1,"Excellent location, and if you literally just need a bed and internet then this is your place."
-1,"it has no common areas and if you stay in the mixed room downstairs the WC and showers are in front of receiption with no doors so is very weird and uncomfortable."
2,"Staff was very nice to me and location couldn't be bettter."
-1,"We stayed at the attic at the 6th floor, it was huge!"
2,"My husband loved it"
-1,"I hated climbing up and down 6 storeys...love it that they had a kettle to boil water."
1,"."
-1,"lighting was pretty dim."
1,"."
1,"I think those that came with bigger groups of friends would love the attic, there were two sofas in the room."
1,"."

1,"Hostel was a fine place to stay for 14€"
-1,"we probably wouldn't return."
1,"Staff were friendly/helpful."
2,"Location was good."
-1,"4 bed private room was large with high ceilings so was very cold- weather was freezing outside."
-1,"There were only thin wierd smelling blankets and pillows provided with hair on them!"
-1,"We were too scared to leave anything valuable there as the locker was broken and the front door had clearly previously been broken into- lots of paint and wood chipped under a new lock."
-1,"The mattress' were broken, lumpy and uncomfortable and bunkbeds were broken."
-1,"This is quite simply the least inviting place I have ever stayed in, including three of Amsterdam's other budget hostels."
-1,"That is to say I had low expectations"
1,"was still let down."
-1,"  Nowhere to relax (two 2-seat couches for 40 guests?)"
-2,", shocking security arrangements, lights too bright in the room, cramped and all-too-visible washing and toilet facilities, hot water only available from the shower."
-1,"  The staff's local knowledge was non-existent too.,"
1,"they were friendly enough."
2,"Great location, friendly staff, clean, handy lockers in bedroom, good value for money."
1,"Kitchen should be bigger"
2,"Amazing big double room not very expencive, 5 minutes fron the train station and from downtown, really nice and comfortable."

-1,"After a first night which was very cold (the heater didn't work), we complained and the gave us an electrical heater."
1,"The second night was much nicer !"
3,"The hostel is overpriced for the quality of the facilities, the kitchen consist in a microwave, a couple of cups, kettle, and a table and it is located right in the bathroom."

2,"on the other hand is very well located right in the city center, near from the train station and supermarkets."

1,"."
-1,"if you're looking for a cheap bed for a few nights, this is it."

-1,"should be mentioned somewhere for people who are always cold)."
-1,"During weekend I think noone cleaned our bathroom and it wasn't in a perfect shape, there was no toilet paper."

1,"If your looking for the basic package its ok nothing special you get a bed and a locker"
-1,"the location of the toilets left a lot to be desired, right next to the kitchen area ( a ledge a few plates and a kettle)"
-1,"then again it's Amsterdam so I suppose u don't have to use it."
2,"The room is roomy and pleasant."
3,"The location is excellent,"

2,"located in a great location, WiFi working great all the time and the stuff was mire than helpful."
-1,"The pictures from the site are not the real deal."

-1,"Ad no kitchen, no table to read in room an only 1 plug."
1,"Lucky for the people who were staying there at that moment."
2,"There was a English girl, with a plug multiplyer."
-1,"The matras is nothing and in winter time in Holland i really advise to bring a sleepingbag because the blanket provided is thinner as u skin."
1,"well located (5 min away from Centraal Station)."
-1,"Good enough if you just need a bed in a dorm for a very short stay."
-1,"- Not really a kitchen, just some stuff in the corner of the bathroom."
-1,"Bathroom is a open area direct next to the reception desk, with tiny facilities."
-2," - noisy and shaky bunk beds, no real pillows and blankets, therefore too cold to sleep comfortably  - no common room  Overall no comfort for few money."

2,"free internet and nice location, next to train station and shopping streets."
-1,"A great hostel to stay in :) staff were extremely helpful!!"
2,"The location is really good, very close to the train station, and it's on the big road, so very convenient."
1,""
-1,"it's too noisy at night."

-1,"they just give you a thin blanket, it's a little cold at night."
-1," No breakfast."
2,"The rooms were very nice and I thought that everything was kept pretty clean."

-1,"it wasn't a big deal."
-1,"I felt safe the whole time and felt that my belongings were safe too."
3,"I really appreciated the free internet!"
2,"Overall, I think it was a great experience."
-1,"Only a 10-15 min walk from the train station."
-1,"15 min walk to the red light, close to all your restaurants and night life, I was here during ADE so plenty going on and wasnt far from many of the clubs."
2,"A great place to store my stuff and crash"
-1,"my particular bed was a shocker, made a noise to any movement."
2,"its beautiful room with a good view we have, and a little balcony with windows, unfortunately there's no kitchen."
-1,"probably because thats a very old building, so they're afraid of getting fire."
1,"we got a private double bed ensuite, so its more like a hotel room than a hostel."
2,"its great, the room is very huge!!"
-1,"the problem is, its on 6th floor and there's no elevator, its trully an exercise."
1,"it doesnt matter for us."
2,"we are very happy of stayed there."
-1,"Terrible."
-1,"Each morning the guy working at the hostel would walk in, turn the lights on an hour before check out, and play techno music loudly from the reception, which is right next to the dorms."
-1,"The bed consisted of a thin foam mattress, which meant you didn't sleep at all properly."
-1,"The blankets provided where thin, and no where near warm enough for end of October."
-1,"There are only two plugs in the dorm for 20 people, meaning you won't get a chance to charge phones/ipods."
2,"Hostel was good for its price, I was in a 20 room dorm with a couple friends."
2,"The beds are clean and comfortable, good toilets and showers."
-1,"Only thing that needed work was the kitchen that was small and pretty much in the toilet area."
-1,"Only a microwave and small fridge for 30+ people to use."
-1,"The communal area was small and in front of the reception so it was hard to socialise outside of your rooms."
2,"  All in all it was good for its worth and got what you needed the most."
1,"I would go again."
1,"Nice little hostel with rooms in different buildings..."
-1,"We booked this hostel because it was one of the only hostels with vacancy."
-1,"It was fairly cheap, and cheap is what we got."
-1,"The beds were barren, and somewhat dirty."
1,"Fortunately I had a sleeping bag with me as the sheet provided wouldn't have been of any use."
-1,"The staff was not very helpful, and even when advised of basic issues (e.g. no toilet paper in the bathroom) the issues remained unfixed."
-1," If you are on a tight budget, this place is cheap."
1,"the price is about all you get."
2,"Really, really liked it."
-1,"stayed in the 6th Floor 2 single bed private room where we had access to a living space, kitchen, and rooftop balcony."
1,"Is this really a hostel?"
-1,"  The staff were very cool and miss victoria explained everything very clearly."
1,"They even provided a map of the city which would cost you around 3 euros from tourist information."

2,"Staff was great!"
2,"One man with bit longer hair was nice all the time!"
2,"He help us with everything!"
2,"Great really!!!"
2,"Great friendly hostel."
-1,"  Only small detail: the blankets are too thin, duvets might be better (especially in the autumn)!"
-2,"The only think I find annoying were staires cause with luggage to drag it up and down was quite difficult."
2,"the female dorm was nice, clean enaugh."
2,"Be aware that it's better to bring you own balnket since they give you just plaid without any blanket."
-1,"1 bathroom for 10-12 girls is rather too bad I didn't experience many problems with it since all girls had different time schedule."
-1,"There was a mouse in the room that ate the food who were in bags that guests left the ground at night."
2,"And every day we had to wake up at 9 o'clock, because the woman cleaner opened the room, opened the windows and began to clean up even when you're sleeping."
3,"A great lack of respect!"
-1,"We booked a room for 4 people in a private dorm."
-1,"We were pleased to notice the cleanliness and the size of the room."
-2," The only problem in this room is that Amsterdam is quite cold the whole year and the blanket provided were really thin and old."
-1,"We would have hoped to get some real bed sheets with real blankets."
-1,"It was hard on all of us."
2,"The people who work there make that place amazing!"
2," also the art of the hostel is amazing."
-1,"This hostel was cheap and no fuss."
-1,"The staff were friendly and the location of the hostel is excellent, only five minutes walk from Centraal Train Station."
-1,"I wouldn't stay here if you are staying in Amsterdam for more than four days - there are very few powerpoints and the rooms are huge with loads of beds, so not much privacy."
-1,"there are a couple of computers with free internet, and you're only a few minutes walk from everything."
2,"The hostel is well located"
-1,"the staff is not friendly (there is an exception)."
-1,"The room is disorganized and they don't have pillows, they offer something like a small pad to sleep."
1,"They don't have a kitchen"
1,"just a microwave"
1,"they don't offer plates or cutlery."
1,"It means you can't prepare anything to eat there."
-1,"There is no a table to eat or to use your own computer as well."
-1,"Very minimal and small"
-1,"cheap and in a good location."
-1,"Excellent location in central Amsterdam."
-1,"Too many stairs and noisy guests,"
2,"if you just want to sleep there it's very good!"
2,"Not really a great place to stay to be honest, I felt like staying in on of those places that gives charity to homeless people."
-2,"The room is just horrible, you can hear everything from the outside, even the steps from people walking on the sidewalk, no heat at all, the blanket was so thing that I had to sleep with my sweater because it gets so cold at night and also they don't even bother on changing the bed sheets, and they open leave the door open in the morning,even if you are still sleeping."
-1,"My dorm was in the adjacent building, on the fourth floor with no elevator."
1,"the room was airy and bright, with an ensuite bathroom and a kitchenette (fridge and sink, no stove)."
-1,"Each guest gets a locker for free (10 euro deposit)."
1,"The dorm for women seemed A LOT nicer than the onw for men"
2,"This hostel was very clean and the location was perfect - really close to everything."
2,"We enjoyed our stay here."
-1,"Definitely not a party type hostel which isn't necessarily a bad thing it just depends what you are after."
2,"This place is in a great location, the showers are small"
2,"pump out hot water, wifi is strong, the staff are helpful and the place is nicely decorated."
1,"Most guests found it strange to have the reception right there next to the toilets showers and wash basins."
-1,"I didnt mind too much especially when your towel drops while your brushing your teeth and 4 danish girls are checking in next to you."
-1,"They need thicker beds,pillows and checkout should be 11am."
1,"These simple things might improve ya rating!"
1,"the hostel was OK,"
-2,"way too expensive for the facilities provided.the hostel was cold, dirty and the code for the door could have been broken by a monkey."
-1,"Iv been to Amsterdam many times and all the budget accommadation in the city center is bad and very pricey, I ask why?"
2,"It was great"
-1,"kitchen should be little big n separate from  washroom area."
1,"I give 8/10"
2,"I had a great stay at Aivengo."
2,"Really nice staff and the all-female dorm was great."
-1,"The mixed dorms on the ground floor looked really hectic, so I wouldn't stay there if I were travelling with a mixed group,"
-1,"I would definitely stay there again in the female dorm."
-1,"You pay for what you get, It was a cheap option that I was pretty happy with really."
1,"Would stay here again."
2,"Handy and a bit more quiet location"
1,"in the center."
2,"We stayed in a big dorm located in a building next door, a large, nice, and light room with its own kitchen and bathroom and semi-balcony."
-1,"The only thing that was not so satisfying were the iron beds keeping a lot of noise, can they be lubricated or something?"
2,";) Otherwise totally recommended!"
-1,"it is not possible to get a nights sleep here as lights are always on in the dorm room nd no one will keep theire voice down even late at night."
1,"so if you come to party and need a place to crash this may be it."
-1," if you come to do stuff during the day this is not recommended."
-2,"also the bed I slept in was very poor, I´ve slept on benches that was better."
-1,"the toilet is too small, only blanket for cover is not enough, better to have plug in the room"
-1,"The hostel was clean and well-managed and the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful."
-1,"They offered suggestions on where to go, including how to stay safe because we were two females travelling alone."
-1,"Any concerns we had were dealt with quickly and efficiently."
-1,"A bag was left behind on our last day and the staff went out of their way to have it returned."
2,"I had a fantastic stay and would definitely go back to Aivengo if I am ever in Amsterdam again."
2,"I recommend staying here!!"
1,"We had a fabulous time at the Aivengo."
-1,"We were travelling in a group of 9 and felt like we had our own private flat."
2,"The staff were nice and helpful and the location was excellent."
-1,"The only downfall we had was that the hot water ran out after around the 6th persons shower, make sure you get in first!"
2,"We had a fun filled weekend!"
2,"Wonderful location (practically in the center)."
1,"Safe area."
1,"Would stay again."
-1,"Only warning is be ready to be fighting to keep your phone with battery since there are only four electrical outlets for 20 people."
-1,"I agree with everyone that the blanket was too thin."
2,"I slept under my jacket as well to keep warm."
2,"Otherwise an acceptable centrally located hostel at a good price."
2,"I thought the security on the female dorms was good, and the staff were friendly."
-1,"I wish the sinks and the shower were not in the same room, because brushing your teeth in the morning could take a while."
2,"The internet was free, which was great,"
-1,"tended to be unreliable, particularly during peak periods."
1,"I'd stay again."
2,"Good price."
-1,"We booked for 3 people in a 10 person room."
-1,"The room was overbooked, so we were always 11-12 people, and there was ONLY ONE bathroom for all of us (which also contained the shower, so for one you waited forever) ."
-1,"To top it off the bathroom made the room noisy constantly."
-2,"  The last night I had a matress instead of a bed, so I was provided with a 'matress' that was maybe 5 cm thick, and a pillow that was smaller than my wallet."
-1,"It would have been the same if I slept on the floor."
-1,"The hostel is quite easy to find n is a convient location as it is near the Amsterdam central station."
1,"Besides the hostel doesn't have elevator n I have to go to 5/F every day, everything is pretty good."
2,"wow!"
2,"For a hostel a this price I have to admit I was scared and sceptical!"
1,"People who are used to sleepe in hostel will understand ;)!"
2,"very good stay, we were able to let our luggage at the reception the last day."
2,"Everything if very well furnished and very clean and guess what!"
2,": quiet by night in the middle Amsterdam!"
-1,"The people sleeping here are here to sleep and not continuing their night!"
2,"highly recommended!"
2,"Bring your own sheets."
2,"The female only dorm is good."
1,"The mixed dorm not that attractive..."
-1,"We stayed in the female room on the 4th floor."
1,"The room and the facilities were pretty much OK except for several things."
-1," If you need wifi you better stay on the first or second floor, because the signal doesn't reach the upper floors."
-1,"Be aware that there are mice on the premises - a lot of them :) They come out only in the night and if you leave any food outside the kitchen cabinets, fridge or inside your bag you'll not be able to sleep."
-1,"Do not leave your bags open in the night!"
1,":)"
-1,"Uncomfortable bed in a cold room with only a very thin blanket."
-1,"Don't expect a good nights sleep here."
2,"Free WiFi is good"
1,", as is the location."

-2,"too Cold, very bad condition."
1,"need some renewal."
2,"investing some € is a must!"
-1," Stuff was Okay, location is close to the main station."
-1,"Cute inexpensive hostel within 5min walking distance of Amsterdam central station."
2,"Very charming."
2,"The dorm we stayed in was equipped with fridges, a microwave and an electric kettle - very practical!"
-1,"Only the beds were slightly uncomfortable,"
-1,"we were so tired at the end of the day that we slept anyway."
1,"^^"
-1,"The place was not well illuminated, and the beds were not comfortable."
-1,"IT DID NOT HAVE SOCKETS TO CHARGE THE BATTERIES OF COMPUTERS AND CAMERAS...WE ARE TRAVELING, SO WE NEED ELECTRICITY FOR OUR EQUIPMENTS!!!"
-1,"The rooms were not well warmed, and there are not places to eat."
1,"should be more selfserved dishes or cooking instuments"
3,"It was nice and pleasant stay."
2,"Good considering the budget."
2,"Everything was very good except for the beds which were noisy and unconfortable I will sure recommend this place"
2,"Good Hostel, great location."
-1,"It is negative that this hostel has no space for kitchen and living room."
-1,"And it was really annoying that they were opening the door every morning at 9 o clock and the cold was passing inside the room."
2,"They must respect their clients"
2,"Great location!"
1,"Everything you would expect for the price."
1,"Nasty place"
2,"in a very good location...DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE!"
2,"The location is amazing, and I felt very safe in the neighborhood by myself even at night."
-1,"I stayed in the female dorm which I would definitely recommend to other females."
2,"Its a cool loft setup with our own bathroom and kitchen."
-1,"The mixed rooms were right off reception along with the bathrooms and seemed like they lacked any privacy."
-1,"There was also no common room so its difficult to meet people outside of your dorm."
1,"Ultimately"
3,"I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again!"
-1,"the room was great, the lobby was a bit smelly."
2,"overall very recommendable!"
2,"rooms are very nice with lock provided."
-1,"there is no elevator, so that it had been quite difficult to take the luggage upstairs..."
1,"Shared rooms: people who think that beds are for sleeping, BEWARE!"
-1,"My roommates decided that since outside was cold, drinking alcohol in public places is prohibited and the pubs are expensive, they had the same right to start party in the bedroom after midnight as other people had to try to sleep in their beds."
-1,"So don´t you think that you will find a quiet place just because it is not in the pub area."
1,"No complaints at all."
-1," Would I stay again?"
1,"Yes."
-1," Would I recomment to friends?"
1,"Yes"
2,"Extremely helpful and friendly staff :) Thank you!"
2,"Amazing location... super clean, open loft dorms."
-1,"Beds aren't the most comfortable,"
2,"all the same its a great hostel."
-1,"This was a big let down from the description...needs some love...twin room was a mess....not clean enough....foul smell from the sink in the en suite...squeaky beds...the blind door to the toilet was broken an pointless even being there...bed covers are far too thin so we were cold at night apart from all that the location was good"
-1,"just somewhere to sleep really."
2,"staff is very friendly ."
1,"."
2,"and the location is perfect"
2,"Loved the staff esp."
2,"the Czech republic guy so really friendly, takes initiative carried my suitcase and just such a pleasant smile."
-1,"I stayed in the 13 bed female dorms with ensuite bathroom/ kitchen on 4th floor."
2,"I agree with another guest, mattresses are so tiny you can feel every bar of the bed."
-1,"Blankets and pillows are thin what a joke."
-1,"some ppl may say this was a bad thing, for me it was great as I love happy places"
-1,"6 girls couldn't stop laughing for hours and hours, you wonder"
2,"Very small towel in the private room!"
1,"Ask to the guests to take one with them."
2,"Exept for this great room almost at the roof top and great location."
1," I hope to join you again."
1,"I stated in the 10 bed all girls dorm."
1,"It was cute and clean with its own bath, kitchen, fridge, lockers you must rent."
1,"You get a sheet and a hand towel free."
2,"There ARE mice."
1,"One girl saw one and I had a bag of food chewed through."
1,"Free wireless on the ground floor and a computer."
1,"NO common area."
2,"The staff, particularly the Czech guy, are very helpful and friendly."
2,"The location is great for getting to and fro the train station and exploring the Red Light District."
-1,"In virtually any direction from the hostel there is something to do or see."
-1,"The 20 bed dorm does the job ok, and its not the Hostels fault you get people at all hours making noise and switching all the lights on."
-1,"The showers and toilets are opposite and in full view of the reception, which sucks a bit."
-1,"Cannot rate this place enough."
-1,"I was there in Sept 2011 and stayed on the 4th floor."
1,"Lockers for each person."
-1,"Staff were very helpful when I had friends arriving on different days, they made sure we were all in the same room."
1,"Place was clean and location ideal - close to Centraal station and close to Dam Square!"
2,"Will definitely go back!"
1,"I get what I expected."
-1,"be careful if you have dust-allergies: the blankets are quite dusty."
2,"A very nice place."
2,"For being so small, it was still well maintained and the staff was very friendly."
1,"Excelent!"
2,"It's an amazing hostel, I'd tell anyone to go there!"
2,"The staff were lovely, let us borrow their umbrellas."
-1,"There was a little concussion with payment that was quickly resolved."
-1,"It needs to be stated that a cat is always present in the hotel common room because I am highly allergic."
-1,"It created a poor experience."
-1,"I had 2 mice under my bed and after having noticed them at night I went to the reception in the next morning."
-1,"The staff said it's "normal" in Amsterdam and that they'd have traps and would put more in our room."
1,"They did NOTHING!"
-1,"So the next night we prepared the mice's "house" on ourself with some magazines and a chair and could sleep (like maybe the mice did?!)"
1,"."
1,"Maybe mice are the price we paid for having a bed in an Amsterdam hostel for 11,-€/night...?!"
-1,"A hostel better suited for younger travellers and party-ers."
-1,"So many people in one room makes it a bit noisy for sleeping."
1,"in a central location."
1,"The mattresses urgently need to change."
-1,"They are so thin that the main bar in the bed-frame stuck into my back."
-1,"If you need a flat bed, this is not the place."
-1,"Nice hostel to know more abt the building in Netherlands... It's in a traditional building... Narrow building...:) If the floor can b much clean( some dirty left near my bed ) n with Wifi in rooms upstairs."
1,"."
2,"It will b perfect!"
1,"Disclaimer: My girlfriend and I had our own room with a private bath."
-1,"These accommodations are not even in the same building as the regular hostel."
-1,"Hence, my review does not speak to what most people will experience there."
-1,"Doesn't have a common area so if you want to meet people you´ll have to do it outside or in the 22 mixed room (as i did)!"
2," I changed to a 10 female room the last night and it was perfect, really big place, clean and with many facilities!"
2,"Just good for a bed and thats it."
-1,"no kitchen, no extra room"
-2,"Most annoying thing were the hostel staff opening the door and switching on the lights at 9am, starting to make the beds, plus talking fairly loudly (not too sure if that was mainly guests to be honest)."
-1,"Didn't have high expectations as I read the previous reviews,"
-1,"was still rather disappointed with how small and unfriendly everything seemed."
-1,"Cheapest hostel I could find over the weekend"
-1,", there was a bed (not a comfy one), alright bathrooms and internet, so it's all I needed."
-1,"Good location near central station and dam square, cheap by Amsterdam standards!"
2,"helpful staff and very clean, would stay again."
2,"I thought the hostel was in an excellent location and was clean, tidy and good value for money."
2,"The staff were very friendly and spoke perfect English."
-1,"The wifi didn't work very well"
-1,"and it was shame that there was no communal area."
1,"the shower smelled."
-1,"there were mice in some other rooms, the 'kitchen' is a fridge with a microwave on top of it, there were NO outlets except at the front desk, and it was overcrowded."
1,"3 days with 6 girlfriends."
1,"A 4 bedroom ensuite and a 2 bedroom ensuite."
1,"Upon arrival we were told that the 2 rooms were each in a different building in a different street."
2,"The 2 bedroom ensuite was nice:it had bedding + good matresses."
1,"4 bedroom ensuite:2 bunkbeds."
-1,"I travelled over the world in the cheapest places and I have never seen matresses like that before."
-1,"The matresses: completely worn out."
-1,"Al I saw and felt were the springs."
-1,"Even sleeping on the bare floor would be nicer."
1,"Had free wifi and computer available."
1,"Only three working showers while we were there for the whole hostel."
1,"There were mice in the room."
1,"Not much of a common area."
1,"Located walking distance from the train station."
-1,"Myslef and 3 friends stayed at Aivengo 24th-26th June 2011."
2,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
2,"The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful in helping us find our way around the area."
2,"The hostel was nice, clean and tidy."
1," Would definitey recommend if you were going for a fun weekend in Amsterdam and want to be close to all the best palces around town."
-1,"  Thank you Aivengo!"
1,":)"
2,"This hostel was good"
-1,"cooking facilities were lacking."
1,"if you are looking for somewhere to crash for a couple of nights this place is cool"
1,"expect to be woken up regulary if you stay in the 20 person dorm!"
2,"Good overall!"
2,"It was a good value for the money."
1,"The staff were nice,"
-1,"not exceptionally friendly."
1,"The internet was good, I wish there had been more outlets,"
1,"."
-1,"Staff were helpful and they have computers with internet that are free to use."
1,"Located close to the main train station."
-1,"Only drawback is that the doors are locked for 2 hours every night (4-6 AM)"
1,"that wasn't a problem for us."
-1,"I stayed for two nights in this hostel."
2,"THE hostel has a great location and excellent staff."
2,"Staff is helpful and can speak english very well."
-1,"One thing that i did not like is that there was quite a lot of noise at night from vehicle passing by the road and also improvement is needed in beds as they were not very comfortable."
2,"overall a very good hostel at a budget price and location wise."
2,"Nice hostel and really friendly!!!"
-1,"Inside the rooms doesn't have plug/ switches to charge mobile, camera or other things."
-1," So hard... Because all the time we need to ask the receptionist and then to leave there all the stuff charging."
2,"It's the best you can get considering the location, helpfull and patient staff."
-1," free internet !"
1,"wifi !"
1,"that one was of the hook !"
-1,"When we reached the hostel, we are being told to go to another street where our room is located.and its located on a small street which we think its not safe,"
-1,", luckily nothing dangerous happen during our stay."
2,"our room is very clean."
-1,", the mattress are very old and we slept till our back is very painful."
-1,"I fount the hostel very dirty!"
2,"I was actually shocked with the state of the bed I was given."
-1,"It was a bunk bed and the top bed had a terrible smell."
-1,"I didnºt even use their bedding cos i found it in a very bad condition."
-1,"My bed sheet had a massive hole in it and not a single person cared for it."
1,"i will never go back there again!"
-1,"Plus the rip off for such a dirty place."
2,"The hostel was in a great location,"
-1,"lacked a general common room, which made sleeping and meeting people very unpleasant."
-1,"The matresses were paper thin onto metal grid beds - very uncomfortable."
-1,"The lack of kitchen facilities does not contribute to a budget holiday."
-1,"There are several floors, which is unlucky if you're on the bottom floor because you can hear people stomp around upstairs."
-1,"The noise from the street is also very loud."
-1,"the toilet smells even after cleaning."
1,"."
1,"room with 20 beds actually has 22."
1,"."
2,"has free towels, lockers, centred."
1,"."

2,"rooms beautifully decorated, warm atmosphere!!"
2,"Very helpfull staff!"
2,"Big recommend!!!"
2,"Thank You and see You again guys!!!!"
2,"I love the location, walking distance to the main central station, and they have a super market very close by."
-1," We had the private room, and the bathroom had a jacuzzy, which I didn't have time to use."
-1,"It had a little kitchen with small refrigerator,"
-1,"no microwave, nor utensils to cook."
-1,"The only bad thing is that the room is on the 6th floor, and no elevator, other than pretty good for the price we pay."
2,"Very friendly stuff, they offered to help with the luggage."
2,"I would stay here again, primarily because of the location and the price."
3,"Both were excellent."
-1,"Plus they have free internet which is useful."
-1,"Downsides are that the bed was pretty uncomfortable and there was only one bathroom in the dorm between 10 girls - ok if you get up earlier than everyone else,"
1,"if not you'll have to wait around or go outside and back into the main building where there's more showers."
-1,"There also isn't a communal area to hang out so that reduces the social aspect a bit."
1,"The hostel is in front Red Light,"
2,"is closer to the central station."
-1," The clenear enter in your room before the check out and i was in the bathroom, i didn't like this situation!"
-1,"this was my first time to Europe and to a hostel."
-1,"I've visited several countries now and so far Aivengo has been a GREAT hostel."
3,"i recommend it to every one."
2,"The location is the best, as soon as you walk out you already have everything Amsterdam has to offer; bars, restaurants, coffee-shops, red-light, mini-markets, magic shops, metro station."
1,"i was amazed of all the things that are available from the door step of this hostel."
2," now the staff, this guys are really cool, very helpful and very nice."

-1,"The dorm was really big, lots of space and not very noisy."
1,"I would stay here again!"
2,"Thank you :)"
-1,"Towels are not free as it is mentioned in their web site."
1,"It cost 1€."
1,"A nice cheap hostel."
1,"Was a bit hesitant about staying in a 20 bed dorm"
2,"was good."
2,"Showers were great."
-1,"Only complaint I have is that they left the door to the dorm open from 9am letting noise from reception in and making it hard to sleep in."
2,"So bring your earplugs/eyemask."
1,"Also note the lock out 4-6am."
2,"They only provide 1 blanket, so I brought 1 of my own,"
1,"to be honest the heating is turned up enough that it was sufficient for me."
1,"I did hear a guy next to the window complain"
1,"."
2,"Bring something warm to sleep in."
-1,":) The staff at the desk were sooo helpful and welcoming."
2,"Thank you!"
2,"This hostel was close to Centraal Station, downtown Amsterdam, and the staff was really nice."
-1,"You do get what you pay for and there seemed to be no heat in the hostel when I visited in February."
-1,"No biggie considering what I saved in money."
-1,"The only suggestions I would make is to remove the non-functioning door (serves as a window now?)"
-1,"they have in the mixed dorm room because it lets the cold in and you can hear everybody's conversation smoking outside through that door."
1,"You get what you pay for!"
-1,"The 4 person room was very very basic and the bunk beds were like sleeping on rocks,"
2,"after being on the lash all day its somewhere to crash."
1,"The shower was really good and the location was 5 mins from everywhere, i think the receptionist was a bit hangover on our arrival"
2,"a pleasant guy."
-1,"Would recommend if your a group of mates after a bed with a roof over your head and thats it, which close to the station and main bars etc"
2,"The dorms were nice and clean."
-1,"The only problem was that there was only one shower for 10 girls to share."
3,"So there was a lot of waiting... The location was excellent!"
2,"I'd definitely stay there again."
1,"Only 2 plug points"
2,"we enjoyed our stay a lot!!"
2,"it was a really nice place."
2,"i recommend this to all first timers and experienced travelers."
2,"I think the best thing about this hostel is the location."
1,"They had warm water."
1,"Nothing else!"
-1,"We stayed in a twin room with a bathroom."
-1,"It was the smallest and most uncomfortable room I’ve ever stayed."
-1,"Moreover, you can’t use half of the room as the ceiling gets lower and lower."
1,"It was in the sixth floor and they didn’t offer any help"
1,"I had asked for it."
-1,"The room was not that clean."
1,"The bathroom looked so so,"
1,"I had to clean someone else’s hairs in the tiny shower cabin.Bathroom had a folding door which was broken."
-1,"In other words there was no door in the bathroom."
-1,"We complained about it; they told they would fix it,"
-1,"they simply ignored it."
-1,"The beds were terrible."
-1,"We woke up each time we turned around and it was not possible not to turn as you feel the bedsprings in your back."
-1,"There were no extra blankets and we slept with our coats and hats."
1,"The staff needs social training."
-1,"Most probably he felt how disappointed we were"
-1,"instead of trying to compensate, he avoided eye contact."
-1,"When I complained about the hairs in the bathroom, they only looked at each other and didn’t say one single word to us."
-1,"If we had had more time in Amsterdam, we would have definitely tried to find somewhere else."
-1,"I would never ever recommend Aivengo Hostel to any of my friends."
1,"Horrid!"
2,"Good in general."
-1,"some facility is not sufficient, such as socket and pantry."
-1,"Even not a single socket in the room that 20 people stay."
2,"Perfectly adequate!"
1,"Would stay here again."
2,"My friend and I were in the 10 bed female dorm and we had a great stay."
-1,"Everyone else in the full room was very respectful and quiet."
-1,"This isn't a party hostel, it's a place to sleep."
2,"I felt that everything was clean and the beds were surprisingly comfortable."
2,"I also liked that the female dorm is 10 separate beds, not bunk beds."
1,"The room is very large and felt airy."
2,"It even has a nice little balcony too!"
1,"As a heads up, there is a red light corner nearby"
2,"Great experience at Aviengo Hostel."
2,"The staff was very kind and helpful throughout my stay."
2,"The hostel is in a great location, and the beds were very comfortable."
2,"Overall, a great stay that satisfied all my needs."
-1,"We had a private room."
2,"It was clean and safe, which is all we really asked for."
-1,"Staff were helpful if we had a query."
1,"Would stay again."
1,"no air con"
1,"its in a great location the size of bathroom and shower room was a joke"
-1,"its decent no one wanted to talk to each other and there was no way meeting new people"
2,"5 of us from the US stayed at this hostel and loved it."

1,"taking a few steps out into the city fixed that."

-1,"From all the hostels I have stayed, this is the worst."
-1,"Price is abaurdly high (I paid 45 euros per night) and quality is way too poor."

2,"The staff was really good and helpfull, cosy place!"
2,"If i go back to amsterdam i will deffenitly live there again!"

-1," They were really unpolite."
-1,"The hostel is not bad.It's a VERY low-cost hostel which is good for people who don't really care to have a nice stay"
-1,"just a place to sleep."

2,"Very good location only."
-1,"Dirty facilities, bad atmosphere, no kitchen facilities."
-1,"The only thing I liked from Aivengo Hostel was that the bathrooms were clean and the staff members were nice to us."
-1,", the Hostel's reception/ living room is too small and uncomfortable."
-1,"I was staying in a 22-beds room, I think they can be rearrange, somehow, in a more organized way, so it would give a more private appearance."
-1," In addition, there is only ONE plug for the 22 beds, so it was impossible for me to charge my cel phone and my camera."

2," Apart from them very nice conditions and clean to stay, easy access to many fun places in Ams."
2,"hey everyone!"
-1," it wasnt a bad stay - and with a room that holds 20 people, it often depends on the individuals,"
1,"there wasnt a real feel of cleanliness."
-1,"i was in an upper bunk-bed - a thin matrices held up by thin metal beams and on thick pole through the centre pressing through the bed and into my back - which wasnt particularly comfortable and the locker felt like it had been forcefully opened before...  it wasnt a bad stay and served its purpose, and the price was fine..."
-2,"Really colorfull place, the 20 people room only has a small window, so there is a lack of air circulation."
2,"Despite that, beds are really comfortable and the staff is really nice."

2,"Location is superb, within a short walking distance to dam, red light etc."
-1,"Pretty small place with minimal facilities,"
2,"makes up for it by being in in a great location."
2,"Amsterdam is pretty expensive,"
-1,"18/14 Euro for a Weekend/Weekday bed is a little on the pricey end."
-1,"Since megadorms are the only option here, you might get rudely interrupted by other drunk hostellers late at night if you're not into that sort of thing yourself."
1,"Nice, clean and cheap hostel."
1,"Close to everything ;)"
2,"In general this was a good hostel."
2,"It's definitely well priced and was the cheapest we found in Amsterdam."

2,"The showers and toilets very clean and the hostel is very weel situated just near by the central station."
3,"Perfect location, friendly and welcoming staff and I will definitely be coming back!"
-1,"1) They should buy pesticides against moulds 2) Latted frames instead of card boards for ALL beds would be nice 3) Basins and shower only with folding door and not separated - can take ours till you can get in front of the mirror/basin 4) Not very logic, if you book a GIRLS ONLY room,"
-1,"a room allocated to this one being for private use (or rented as well) and there are MALES in there crossing your FEMALE room several times a day without knocking 5) 10 persons in room + 2 "private" - 1 toilet"
2,"This hostel was really cool!"
-1,"We wanted to find one of the cheapest place, where to stay during the night in downtown."

1,"."
1,"which is to be expected in a room full of 20 people."

-1,"No kitchen, just a microwave and some appliances next to the wc's."
1,"The rest was ok."

3,"Really would recommend this hostel!"
2,"Aivengo is a quite well located hostel.I stayed with a friend for 2 nights,and we were satisfied.There were no special safety facilities for your luggage.Everything there was a safe,where you should leave as a deposit 10 euros in the reception and use the key until you go away.In general it was a good hostel.One annoying thing was the curfew between 4 and 6 am,which make you rush back to the hostel,in the chance of being locked out up to 6 am,one thing you should really bear in mind."

-1,"The staff were not that friendly"
2,"its fine because you dont see them that much!"
2,"I stayed in a 10 bed female dorm which was very nice"
-1,"the stairs was very steep and alot of it!"
-1,"so I would suggest staying in a dorm 10 beds or less because the bad reviews are from the doorms that are about 20 beds."
-1,"a toilet seat is the least i expect, this hostel is not in India."

2,"It was good to have a kitchen in the same room,"
1,", the cooker was out of order."

3,"Very fun and colorful hostel!"
-1,"Some of the mattresses in the big dorms are a bit saggy,"
2,"the atmosphere was really nice."
-1," The only thin I missed was a common room or a real kitchen,"
-1,"for the price you really cannot complain."
1,"Will stay again when I'm in Amsterdam next time!"
-1,"price and location were good, this is not a bad hostel"
-1,"the beds were not the most comfortable and i dont think they should be listed as having a kitchen, as it is a fridge and a microwave so you cant really cook proper meals."
-1,"no toilet seats too"
-1,"the staff were super unfriendly and had no suggestions of good places to go and did not want to socialize, which is not what a hostel should be like."
1,"the room was nice,"

2,"Cool location."
-1,"Too bad that there are no toilet seats."

1,"I lived on the 5th floor and no lift!"
1,"Fantastically managed."

1,"Well equipped kitchen."
1,"Our expectations were exceeded."
2,"I knew it was going to be an interesting experience staying in a 20 bed dorm room,"
-1,"this hostel was worse than expected."
-1,"The beds were uncomfortable like sleeping directly on the springs, they may say there are kitchen facilities"
1,"its a bar fridge in a corner with a kettle and microwave directly that is opposite the showers."
-1,"Each morning at 9am, regardless if you are checking out, the staff open the doors to the room and play loud music to make sure people wake 1 hour before checkout."
-1,"The bed is not comfortable."
1,"."
1,"It was ok"
-1,"It was very cold as others had mentioned....the bathrooms were strange- right off the check-in with a curtain in front of them."
3,"A really nice hostel everyone was friendly and it was very clean!"
2,"and in a great location!"
-1,"I stayed in a ten-girl room, the girls got out late in the night and returned in the midnight, talked loud,etc.."
1,"."
-1,"kind of hard to get some good sleep.Shower gets cold if more than one person take a quick shower one after another."
1,"the hostel is very close to the central station..."
-2,"The room I stayed in - 16 all female - was very loud, bright, and the stove didn't work."
-1,"More than anything, I was disappointed by the other women staying in my room - loud and disrespectful."
-1,"The only lights are floor lamps, so when they turned them on at 4 a.m., the entire room lit up."
2,"Otherwise, the hostel is sufficient, clean enough, with nice staff and a good location."
2,"Good value for money, don't expect anything fancy,"
2,"its nice enough."
1,"May be cold in the winter - only one fleece blanket"
2,"The receptionist is nice and friendly."
2,"The en suite quad room is perfect"
-1,"the heater was not really working so it was quite cold at night!"
-1,"Security was very lax for the two 20-person rooms: the front door to the hostel is always open, and the doors to each of the two 20-person dorms were often kept hanging open."
-1,"This meant that if there's no one at reception/if you look like someone who would be using the hostel (they did stop a homeless-looking guy), no one bats an eye when you walk in."
-1," The atmosphere is sub-par, the "kitchen" is really just a kettle and a microwave IN THE WASHROOM."
2,"the staff is nice, and great location."
-1,"The staff was always skyping or on facebook, just a bit awkward."
-1,"Also the front door has no lock and neither do the rooms, so theoretically people could walk right in."
-1,"We weren't given keycards or anything, it was just a walk-in walk-out type thing."
-1,"None of our stuff was stolen"
1,"we definitely felt the need to lock up our stuff."
1,"The only good thing is the location!!"
-2,"Cold shower, thin matresses, barely a pillow and barely a blanket so it was freezing!"
-1,"Every time someone walked upstairs their footsteps on the stairs were ridiculously loud."
2,"I recommend :)"
-1,"The only good aspect in this hostel is the location, because the rest is awful."
-1,"The room is full (22 people) and there is no window."
-1,"We have to pass in the reception to go to the toilet and showers, so embarrassing!"
-1,"There is a microwave oven and a little fridge inside the toilet, terrible!!"
-1,"Someone stole the blanket of my friend and there isn't another one."
-1,"Inside the room is very cold!"
-1,"Also, bed sheet and pillow smell bad."
-1,"Staff are not very polite and simply didn't solve our problems!"
-2,"The hostel is expensive, in general really poor, the location is the only good factor."
-1,"Bathrooms are the worse."
1,"You will be lucky if you could have a hot shower..."
3,"Our stay was perfect as far as we are concerned."
2,"We stayed on the 6th floor in the double room and had gorgeous views all around the city."
-1,"It had loads of storage space and a balcony as well as a huge bay window that opened to views of the Westerkerk and Dam Square."
2,"This was a beautiful place to stay, and they were very friendly- our room was more like a flat or a party pad with loads of space."
-1,"The only downside was being on the 6th floor without a microwave or hob,"
1,"we did have a fridge."
2,"Great location, nice layout of the room, glad to see single beds and not bunk beds."
1,"One bathroom between 10 was rough and not the cleanest"
2,"the location beats all of that."
2,"It was a cute hostel."
-1,"We stayed in the 10bed female dorm."
-1,"It hasn't got an elevator (we had to go up to the fifth floor from the stairs)"
2,"the room was nice and clean!"
-1,"It has a really tiny kitchen (microwave and fridge-so if you want to have a snack,breakfast or a quick meal it's ok-not for actual cooking) It is in the center of the city, near the dam square."
2,"We actually enjoyed our stay there."
2,"It was in a fantastic location, walking distance from many places."
-1,"The only problem we had was it was freezing inside the hostel as well as outside."
2,"If you go during the winter, bring clothes to layer."
3,"Great location, nice people working, gave us lots of advice as to where to go and see, i enjoyed my stay !!"
-2,"only downfalls (in the mixed dorm) were that the bathroom stalls were open to everyone, very small space inside the bathroom and no toilet seats, also always smelt bad, some beds were awful in terms of the mattress there was barely even one and it felt like you were sleeping on wood."
-1,"a very small thin blanket was provided so we were often cold at night."
1,"the female dorm was must nicer !"
-1,"We have been staying in this hostel in march 2013."
2,"The stuff was very friendly and helpful."
2,"Thanks for great athmosphere, you made our stay in Amsterdam unforgettable."
1,"Will come back soon!"
1,":)"
2,"defi great location"
-1,"i guess you will get what you paid, compared to other hostels in Amsterdam."
-1,"no social place unless you start talking ppl in the room... if you are staying one night probably not so bad"
-1,"if you wanna stay longer... search other hostels"
2,"I stayed in the female dormitory for 2 nights."
2,"The environment there was excellent."
2,"It was very safe as it got the lockers to keep the things and other backpackers were very decent and clean."
-1,"The staff was very helpful and gave us a map!"
1,""
-1,", the wifi signal there was not very strong and my phone was always disconnected."
2,"Nice rooms perfect location."
-1,"I had no where to hang out at this hostel."
-1,"The staff wernt very helpful, and the door room was aweful."
1,"I felt like I was sleeping in a military hospital."
-1,"The complimentary bedding is on thin scratchy wollen blanket."
-1,"I had to sleep fully dressed wearing a jacket."
-1,"I would not stay here again."
-1,"I don't recommend this hostel."
-1,"I stayed in an all female room for a weekend and was extremely underwhelmed."
-1,"The staff was ok, the rooms were not as cold as a previous review had stated,"
-1,"it was not a welcoming place."
-1,"We had about 10 people in a bare-bones room with thin, see-through curtains--it felt a bit like an old hospital."
-1," If you really need a place to stay, the location is it's only redeeming quality."
-1,"It wasn't horrible or gross, it was just not worth the money I was spending!"
-1,"The only trouble I faced was the absence of hot water at morning."
2,"All the rest was cool."
2,"The attitude of personnel was good."
2,"Thank you very much :)"
1,"Despite of the bad weather in Amsterdam, the rooms were warm and clean,"
-1,"we had to go 6 floors upstairs everyday, and it was tiring."
-1,"it was sure that nobody were to rob us on this height."
2," The location is perfect (only 5 minutes from the Central Station)."
2,"I recommend it"
-1,"The only thing I could complain is that the room was freezing, and the beds and blanket the cheapest I have ever seen."
2,"Very good hostel, nice staff, safe."
-1,"One problem: we had only one blanket and it was quite cold..."
-1,"This hostel was unbelievably cold and not worth the money we paid."
-1,"In a large room there were only 2 small heaters, and the blankets were unbelievably thin."
-1,"On request for an extra blanket, we were refused, and the staff were not the friendliest in the world."
-1,"If you are going to stay in this hostel, I would advise taking a sleeping bag or an extra blanket."
-1,"Staff is very friendly, the room was nice (8 person dorm), we expected some horror for 11 euro."
2,"Location is great - 5 minutes to the Centraal stations."
-1," The Dam square is also in 5 minutes walk."
-1," Huge minus - the cooker wasn't working even thougg was promised."
-1,"There are very thin blankets in large rooms so at night you would freeze."
1,"Otherwise, it was nice."
-1,"There is nothing wrong with the hostel persay,"
-1,"it was freezing - you are given one small blanket and no sheets."
-1,"I had to sleep in almost all of my clothes every night."
-1,"There is no common area which makes it almost impossible to meet others."
-1,"And the hostel is closed from four to six AM... All of the bars and clubs close right around four so you either have to come back early or stay out really late."
-1,"We realised that the 'door code' to get into our room was redundant and that we did not need to enter a code to access our room."
-1,"To get in and out you do have to go past the reception,"
-1,"that and the provided lockers are thus the only elements of security provided."
-1,"Also, the room was very cold; I suggest either providing duvets instead or thin blankets or turning the temperature up."
-1,"Kitchen is also not a kitchen - only a microwave and a fridge."
2,"Friendly staff and good atmosphere"
1,"!"
2,"Fantastic experience!"
2,"Location can't be beat and staff were incredibly friendly and helpful."
-1,"Probably the worst Hostel I've ever stayed at."
-1,"The staff just sat behind their desk doodling on the computer, the beams from the bunk bed stuck through the mattress, the sheet was just a thin wollen blanket."
-1,"What little of a kitchen there is, is in the bathroom which is also in the reception."
-1,"Also there is no common room so the Hostel has no atmosphere at all whatsoever."
-1,"The only thing going for this Hostel is its location"
-1,"The hostel didnt have a common area that we found and the rooms where next to the hostel shard with a block of flats, which was fine"
1,"its not a place to meet people."
2," The room was very big, clean and included a fridge and an onsuite which we liked,and the staff were really friendly and helpful."
1,"I would stay here again,"
1,"only with friends."
-1,"It was clean enough and I didn't feel unsafe at all."
-1,", the room on the bottom floor is underneath stairs and my bed was also right next to the window, which I didn't mind,"
2,"it is something people may want to be aware of."
-1,"There is also no where to hang out, so plan on only sleeping there."
2,"All is perfect"
-1,"Rooms in another building, no common rooms, the room was cold ...and my bed was next to the heater!!"
2,"the girls room is big, has is own kitchen and the location is good."
1,"Near the train station."
1,"No mirror?!"
1,"They pretty much just have two giant rooms with probably 16 beds or so."
-1,"It was also freezing, there were only one or two radiators in this room and it was below freezing outside."
-1,"The one blanket provided was not really enough so many of us covered up with our jackets or just slept in them."
-1,"The staff were very friendly"
1,", and there are lockers to store your stuff."
-1,"I'm not sure if it was a 10 or 12 person room,"
1,"there were quite a few of us in one large room."
-1,"There was one bathroom, a kitchenette and lockers."
2,"I felt safe because we were all girls."
-1,"It could get a little frustrating (as with any large room) because everyone is on different time schedules."
-1,"The shower head was broken which was a little annoying"
-1,"nothing you can't deal with!"
2,"Overall the hostel was good for our needs, great location!"
1,"Hostel was closed from 4 -6 am."
-1,"for the two night i stayed in Amsterdam, that when i got back to hostel, it was shut., so i had stand outside the hostel till it will open."
-1,"to very impracticable i believe especially when it Amsterdam who knows when people will come back and want to sleep?"
-1,"I was very disappointed not to find any common area in this hostel : no real kitchen ( too close from the sanitary, and without any equipment)."
-1,"There are also no place to meet people (sofa, tables, tv room ...)."
-1,"I expected common area in an hostel."
-1," I was also very surprise to have just a small blanket ( that you don't clean ) for my bed."
-1,"The night in Amsterdam are so cold and I was freezing in my bed."
-1," Then the mix dorm close from the entrance is a freezer, the heating is not working ..."
-1,"We were in a 5th floor dorm - no lift, lots of stairs!"
-1,"The room was spacious with a couch, coffee table, fridge, microwave, kettle and cutlery,etc. there was a seperate toilet and 2 sinks along with a shower in the bathroom."
2,"An extra shower would make it better"
-1,"it was manageable (except when one of the girls took a half hour shower one night)."
2,"Amazing location, cool, chilled out staff, value for money."
2,"Clean, ideal"
-1,"I stayed in a personal flat with 5 of my friends."
-1,"We had a blast and would recommend this site for anyone."
2,":-) Have fun!"
2,"The staff were incredible and"
1,"we were supposed to arrive at 2pm they waiting until 2am to check us in."
2,"Very friendly and helpful and would go again."
-1,"We stayed in the all-girls dorm which only had one other person in at a time, so it was really nice as we felt we had the whole place to ourselves."
2,"In a very accessible place, very close to the central station,"
2,"if you look it up on google maps it shows its on a different part of that road."
-1,"So don't trust google maps."
1,"it's ok..."
2,"not the best, still it is good enough for short stay."
2,"I stayed in the 10 person female dorm."
1,"It was okay"
2,"not very good."
-1,"My bed was terrible, you should renew some."
1,"It was okay clean"
1,"many hair on the floor in the room that is the kitchen/bathroom."
-1,"There is no common room for the whole hostel and no kitchen where you could meet other people than the people in your room so I would recommend it to people travelling in groups."
2,"The room was fantastic."
-1,"The unic fail is that they don't have rooms for 5 persons."
-1,"Ten persons in one room is too much."
1,"the rest was ok!!"
1,"did not like shower ad bathroom set up which is pretty much in the "lobby" area."
-1,"not very good security"
-1,"u can rent lockers if u'd like."
-1,"staff was not too helpful with things."
-1,"its amesterdam and you're really just looking for a place to rest ur head thats not amazingly clean and nice."
1,"it was kinda pricey compared to other hostels i have been to for less quality and value"
3,"great hostel, stayed in the 10 bed female dorm and loved the set up and personal kitchen."
2,"also love the view from the room and the location right next to centraal station and red light district."
2,"The hostel is great for it's location,"
-1,"otherwise it's just a place to sleep."
2,"Staff were always very friendly and helpful."
-2,"Be warned: there are only a few outlets available for use, so if you need to charge anything it can be quite difficult."
-1,"There's not really a common area, so it can be hard to meet fellow travelers."
2,"The receptionist was very friendly and willing to explain the city map."
2,"The Hostel is ideally located, within walking distance of a lot of things."
-1,"The room where I stayed was actually quite spacious and a was sharing the room with 9 other girls!"
1,"best location just in the city center all needed sightseeings withing 15min walking."
2,"nice staff."
-1,"the only disadvantage is that there was no common room to chill and hang out"
3,"It's good place, the staff are very friendly, the beds are good,"
-1,"the rooms are not so clean."
-2,"Facilities are quite in a bad shape, old and it was really cold at night, i even asked for another blanket and they said no."
-1,"What was really not ok, was the stuff - they were extremely unfriendly."
-1,"It was like in the army, no smile or hello, strict "give me passport and money"."
-1,"Kitchen is not a kitchen, there is just microwave."
1,"I wanted to print 1 page of my bus ticket, they charged me 0,5 eur."
-1,"In room with 20 bed these are 2 electricity plug-ins."
-1,"There is no common place to hang out."
2,"Great location and price, staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms and bathrooms were always clean."

2,"Overall great value for money and would definitely stay here again!"
2,"The staff were friendly enough, and quite helpful."
2,"The place is kept clean."
-1,"The price per night drastically increases on the weekend, so factor that in when planning your trip."
-1,"Amsterdam is a blast on weeknights too... My only issue was that there isn't much of a lounge... and subsequently a lack of atmosphere."
2,"Its located on a very cool street in Amsterdam"
2,"it isnt too noisy or busy in front of the hostel, so that was very good."
2,"it wasnt very clean in the room and also looked a bit run down to be honest."
-1,"Also there is a huge problem of space in the hostel."
1,"I think they should work on the subject: cleanliness!"
2,"apart from this it was very good and also affordable and free luggage romm for check out guests!"
-1,"Incredibly easy-going, accommodating, helpful staff."
2,"Always down for small talk and giving great recommendations."
2,"There's a high turn over of guests, which makes the large bedrooms exciting and dynamic (if sometimes noisy at night, with random snores and the ringing phones of heavy sleepers)."
2,"Classic, quality hostel experience."
-1,"And don't get me started on how perfect the location is."
2,"Had such an amazing time in Amsterdam."
2,"I found the staff really helpful, they offered great advice."

-1,"The staff were very unfriendly and not very helpful."
-1,"The 'kitchen' was 1 microwave situated in the toilet room."
-2,"The beds were awful and the bedding provided was too small to provide any warmth at all."
-2,"The worst factor was being woken up every morning around 8 when the staff opened the dorm doors (right next to reception), turned on the lights and played loud dance music."
1,"0 stars."
2,"Definitely a great value."
1,"It's right near the train station and super cheap."
-1,"The rooms are really quiet so you are sure to get a good night's sleep."
2,"I would definitely recommend it if you are traveling light."
-1,"If you have a suitcase it won't fit in the lockers so you have to keep it under your bed or in an unlocked closet at your own risk."
-1,"The girls-only room is a 4-floor walk-up,"
2,"it's even more private and has a cuter bathroom & huge bay window with a nice view."
-1,"I stayed for 3 days."
-1,"Noisy until 4am- receptionist turn on the music until 4 am!!"
1,"Crazy."
1,"."
-1," At night, it's so cold."
1,"."
-1,"Don't heat it up and blanket is so thin!!"
-1," So I asked for print my ticket to receptionist, he wants to get money, it's okay(0.50)"
-1,",,,,the print is poor, I couldn't see the letter!!!!"
1,"What's that?"
-1," Staff is not goot ."
1,"."
-1,"(woman staff is kind) anyway I don't like it everything!"
-1,"Beds are thin and the pillows too"
2,"baths and showers are very clean."
-1," Not a real common area so everyone stand on his own"

-1," It is also well located and it is ok for the money spent!"
1,":)"
2,"The location was excellent,perfect for a tourist that just needs a place to rest."

1,"not enough powerpoints."
-1,"reception is closed from 4 till 6 am."
1,"lots of street noise."

1,":)"
2,"Aivengo Hostel is really nice (just for the private room), good quality and good price ^^ The next time in Amsterdam I will choose the same hostel"

2,"Location was really good, staff was also pretty good."
2,"Bathrooms were also quite good"
2,"really open to the front desk ("
1,"thats alright since everything's got a door anyway)."

2,"For a short stay, it is perfect!"
2,"Great location, could walk from anywhere easily, including the Centraal Station."

-1,"For Amsterdam weather this is not enough, and the rooms were drafty too."
-1,"We stayed in the 8-person female dorm because it was described to have a full kitchen."
-1,"Upon arrival, we discovered the burners and stove top were out of order, and there was no oven."
1,"We were able to keep our food in the refrigerator and use the microwave and toaster to piece together a camping-style dinner,"
-1,"don't expect to actually be able to cook."
2,"I loved staying at this hostel,"
-1,"was disappointed that it was closed from 4-6am and that for the women's dorm only one key was given to us for 3 people."
-1,"I was separated from my group and the other members had to wait until 6am to be given a key."
2,"all in all this hostel does the job, it provides a bed and a shower and really what else do you need."
-1,"it really lacks on the social front."
-1,"There are no common areas, so basically you are confined to your bed."
2,"that being said it was in a good location and it was clean, so really i can't complain."
2,"The location of this hostel was really good, walking distance to everything,"
-1,"the beds were horrible."
-1,"Thin mattresses, you can feel the metal beams, and you are only provided with a thin blanket."

-1,"A common room wouldn't go astray either."
-1,"Not a terrible stay,"
-1,"not great either for the price you have to pay."

-1,"The staff was rude when we asked simple questions and there was no light in the room."
2,"the girls 10 bed doom is great....it has a kitchen (with the basics) and bathroom- its basically a loft with everything you need on one floor with a nice view... great way to meet other girls aswell."
-1,"Realy needs a common room, theres no social aspect to this place at all, the only place you have to relax is your bed."
-1,"You can't buy anything there, you can't meet anyone because you want to be out of bed in the morning"
1,"everyones asleep when you get back."
2,"Great location, clean and had a kitchen in my dorm, plus a locker."

1,"Even"
2,"it was such a big dorm, there was plenty of space and you met so many people at once it was actually a benefit."
2,"The staff were helpful with finding places to visit and the Party Tour in Leidesplein was well worth the money as well!"
1,"The hostel had a bathroom and little kitchen area inside the room"
-1,"there wasn't really a common area for everyone to meet."
-1,"The staff were not helpful at all."
-1,"I had a suitcase and I was on the 5th floor and they would not help me carry it up."
-2,"The used a lame excuse why they couldn't."
-1,"Note- no kitchen or common room."
-1,"You are just in your dorm room of 10 or 20 people.Most people who stay were in grops so its harder for solo travelres to make friends."
-1,"Most come to drink and smoke, so dont be suprised if people come in late at night loud and not caring on whether they bug you or not."
1,"Its Amsterdam after all."
1,"."
-1,"For security, theres a guy that chills at the front desk and the front door to the hostel is left open until 4am just fyi."
1,"Would have been better if the rooms had crates in them as the lockers weren't that big."
-1,"Other than that I would definitely recommend the hostel."
-1,"Stayed in the 10 bed female only room with 2 other friends for 5 nights, we were behind dam square and right next to the red light district!"

-1,"And they have lots of facilities in the room such as refrigerator, microwave, tablewares."

-1,"Nothing wrong with the place at all, it just didn't have much of an atmosphere."
2,"Good walking distance from everything and nice and clean."
-1,"The hostel was supposed to have a kitchen;"
-1,"when I was there it was not possible to cook."
-1,"Also, there was just one bathroom for 10 people, so there was always someone in there."
2,"The hostel was in a good position"
-1,"it was very noisy, from reception and outside."
-1,"having toilets and showers directly opposite the reception desk, behind a curtain, was strange."

2,"staff were really nice."
-1,"not really any common area to hang out."
-1,"the beds were pretty uncomfortable, mattresses were really thin and you can kind of feel the bar in the bunkbed through them,"
-1,"if you take advantage of being in amsterdam you wont notice it when you fall asleep anyways."
2,"We really enjoyed our stay here."
-2,"We stayed 4 nights, and saw that everything was cleaned throughly and often, the staff were very helpful in the background."
-1,"The only security was the staff member on recption, as the front door was open all day and late into the night, and doors to the dorms were open most of the day too,"
1,"lockers were available."
-1,"A common room would have been a big hit, as the only place to socialise with others was 2 couches right at reception."
2,"Overall, quite happy."

-1,"Just a place to sleep."
-1,"The entire hostel was very underwhelming, the main dorms are right "in" the lobby and the bathrooms are in the lobby as well."
2,"Worked very well as a place to just come back and pass out after a long day in the city."
1,"The location and the fact that it had hot water was about the only good things about this property."
-1,"Sharing the room with 9 other girls was just fine except the were 10 or 11 other girls in the room sometimes."
1,"It was advertised as 10 beds in the dorm ont 12."
1,"Also people were smoking in the room when we got there and the whole room stank."
-1,"The place had low ceilings and big wooden beams in the room can you say fire hazard."
1,"The staff should be more vigilant about smoking"
-2,"It was way too hot in the rooms at night which made it difficult to sleep and the mattress/pillows were very thin."
-1,"I didn't have a lot of trouble with the mattress,"
-1,"my three travel companions complained of back aches the rest of our trip."
-1,"We were especially happy with this hostel as they upgraded us to a private room with no extra charge as they didnt have 2 beds in the same dorm for us to stay in!"
-1,"The staff were very friendly and helpful and when we needed help the guy happilly walked over to our apartment with us to give us a hand."
2,"The cleaner came in every morning to clean the kitchen and bathroom, it was definitely worth the price!"
2,"Good hostel to spend the weekend."
-1,"Nothing more, nothing less."
1,"You get what you pay for."
2,"Its a bed and thats all you really need."

1,"Reccommend."
2,"18 beds in a room."
-1,"Tends to be noisy at night with everyone coming and going."
-1,"it's really cheap, so you can't complain much."
2,"Definitely a simple place to stay."
-1,"Very nice large loft style room for the 10-bed room, only bad thing was being on the 4th floor and having to walk up the narrow winding staircase"
-1,"that is apparently typical in Amsterdam."
-1,"Very close to the Centraal station, simple to get to from the airport (train goes from airport to Centraal)."
1,"Short walk to restaurants and bars."
-1,"Didn't seem to have a communal space to meet other travellers,"
1,"had free computers for use."
-1,"One bathroom for 10 girls is too little"
1,"not a huge problem."
2,"Very good place to stay!!!"
2,"Excellent service and great facilities for the price"
-1,"Stayed there for three nights, easy to find from the station, arrived staff were helpful"
1,"from arrival didnt hear much from them at all."
2,"Rooms very spacious and clean."
-1,"Just would of liked more advice from the staff on where to go and what to do in the city compared to the 8 other Hostels this was the least helpful,"
-1,"it wouldn't put me of it still a good hostel."
-1,"I have to admit I was a little bit suspicious when I first saw the hostel."
1,"."
-1,"you should not always trust the first impression!"
-1,"half of our group slept in the mixed room, other half in female dormitory."
-1,"We were really surprised, when we (the other half) saw our room."
2,"It was very cosy and clean and the atmosphere was relaxed."
2,"And we had a cute little balcony!"
2,":) Thank you!"
-1,"The beds are extremely bad."
-1,"everything else is very god."
-1,"Our stay at the hostel was ok for what we were paying, we stayed in a 10 bed girls dorm which ended up having 12 girls with 2 mattress on the floor so we were lucky enough to have an actual bed ."
-1,"the beds how ever were very uncomfortable so lucky we were only there for 2 nights."
2,"Great location and reasonable clean for a hostel in Amsterdam, we had our own bathroom and kitchen."
-1,"would of been very disappointe if we had to use the communal bathroom which was located in reception with the kitchen ew"
2,"I didn't really enjoy my stay at this hostel."
-2,"I didn't really feel safe leaving my belongings in the 20 bed dorm whilst I went out as anyone could just walk in off the street and the door to get into the dorm was often left wide open, even when it was closed, it only needed a simple code to open."
-1,"The beds were like camp beds, with mine creaking and partially collapsed in the middle."
-1,"The hostel was also very loud as footsteps could be heard very clearly walking up the stairs to the floor above."
-1,"Standard hostel, little cramped"
-1,"can't complain bout the price and location."
-1,"Handy location close to central station and very cheap, a proper budget stay."
-1,"There are 4 toilets, 4 showers and 2 twenty bed dorms."
1,"The showers are cramped as is the hostel in general."
-1,"The staff seemed to do the minimum required with little regard for residents comfort, coming in early in the morning switching on the lights and changing the beds none too quietly."
-1,"I was woken on my first night by loud music being played in the foyer (directly outside the dorm) at 5am."
2,"Free Wifi a saving grace."
-1,"Great location in Amsterdam, just a few minutes walk from the train station."
-1," The room was great, not the most trustworthy of locks on the door thought."
-1," The towels were dirty, and no king size sheets, on the king size bed..."
1,"It was in the heart of the city"
1,"it had disadvantages."
1,"."
-1,"the beds were very uncomfortable and you could feel the iron under the bed."
1,"."
-2,"the lights were on all the night and it was very annoying for someone who was sleeping in the upper bed."
1,"."
-1,"the room had an awful smell of the shoes."
1,"."
-1,"it wasn't worth the 35 euros per night that i paid!!"
1,"Great people, relaxed atmosphere, would definitely reccomend the female dorm for girls as the mixed is a little packed & gross,"
2,"I had an great stay!"
2,"Also beware of the stairs!"
-1,"People with suitcases might prefer another hostel, or just set aside a half hour to lug your suitcase up the stairs upon arrival & departure like I did, I was unaware of the stairs & slightly disappointed that it doesn't mention the lack of elevator etc,"
-1,"it didn't effect my stay atall."
-1,"The place is cramped and crowded"
3,"the location is excellent."
-1,"The staff puts extra mats on the floor for additional people to sleep on so the number of guests will be more than listed (which is a little unfair)."
-1,"There is only internet in certain areas and the bathrooms are not very clean and also very small."
-1,"I guess it's the trade-off for a good location which might be worth the steep price if you like convenience."
-1,"The matress are too tiny."
-1,"We can feel the steel bars of the beds."
-1,"I stayed a week in the 20 bed room."
-1,"By day 2 I was really wishing I was staying somwhere else."
-1,"The atmosphere is next to none."
-1,"People sleep at all hours of the day so it's hard to have a conversation with anyone while still respecting the sleepyheads."
1,"The staff are helpful when approached"
1,"dont even say hi when you come back."
2,"It was a really clean place"
1,", which was the only plus."
-1,"This was my first time staying in a hostel/shared accommodation and I would recommend it for short stays."
-1," Everything was average, which isn't a bad thing!!"
1,"the beds were single and pretty standard."
1,"They say the provide towels"
-1,"I would bring one anyway as they are VERY small,"
-1,"you can manage (i didn't bring a spare towel) Also we went at the beginning of June and it was wet and quite cold so I would bear that in mind when packing PJ's cos the room gets quite cold."
-1,"My friend and I stayed at aivengo at the beginning of may."
-1,"It was clean and a place to sleep with a roof over your head."
-1,"The beds didnt all have blankets and when we asked the guy told us people probably took them, so I spent a night with no blankets."
-1,"We were a couple floors up, the higher you go, you will lose wifi which sort of stucks."
-1,"If you need somewhere to sleep in Amsterdam, it's cheap and you get just that."
1,"Over average experience..."
-1,"The staff at this hostel were three friends that were high all the time, therefore not reliable for directions or other questions."
-1,"The cleaning lady starts loudly cleaning the dorms at 9:00Am-- just when literally 13 girls were trying to get ready for the day."
-1,"Not to mention, the dorm had one bathroom for 13 girls to share!!!"
-1,"Can you imagine how long it took to get ready in the morning with that wait?!"
-1,"I had been haphazardly assigned to a cot."
1,"Not enough lighting to read."
2,"Plus MICE."
1,"Seriously."
-2,"staff were unfriendly at best, the doors are locked between 4-6am so if you head out for the night, you have to wait around till you can get back in to sleep on a "matress" thats so thin you can feel the metal bar through the back."
-1,"shower and toilets are in the lobby which, unless your a child or midget are a struggle to fit in."
-1,"one of the worst places i stayed in while travelling through europe"
-1,"The 20 beds room is horriable, mice on the ground."
3,"the location is good, very close to the train station."
-1,"the staff is a little bit cold and absent minded."
1," I live on the 5th floor"
-1,"give me the key of 4th floor, and there is no lift on the building which has a spiral stairs that is difficult to climb."
1," the female room is large"
-1,"the blanket is very thin, making me very cold in the evening!"
-1," the common area is very small, only a sofa beside the reception desk."
2,"amazing atmosphere and great location."
2,"definitely would and will come back when going to amsterdam next time!"
1,"LOL."
-1,"This is not the Ritz, actually it kind of sucks sleeping there."
-1,"Only sleep here if you plan on being so ridiculously high that you won't have any issue falling asleep instantly."
-1,"on their website they advertise wifi, and there is no wifi in the rooms, just in the lobby which has space for 3 or 4 people to sit, which is always full."
-1,"There are mice, which are expected,"
2,"they run around the rooms, and eat the food."
-1,"We stayed in a 12 person female dorm/ensuite and had to share one bathroom between 12 of us, which was not very nice."
-1,"and for having 6 or 7 floors, there is no elevator,"
-1,"you can't change the structure of the building so that couldn't really be changed."
-1,"The hostel itself was very close to nearby attractions."
-1,"They offered a locker for a deposit of 10euros."
1,"Only 2 electrically outputs in the main reception"
1,"."
-1,"There is a curfew between the hours of 4-6am."
-1,"Staff seemed friendly enough and were helpful."
2,"In the center of the world, with all you need and all you wish."
2,"Probably the best hostel I've ever been, I'll return there for sure."
2,"This hostel was the most fun place I stayed at throughout my stay in Europe,"
-1,"it was also the worst hostel in terms of facilities."
1,"The showers take a while to get warm (they do get warm), and the sheets were just abysmal,"
1,"I was lucky enough to bring my own."
2,"There is one staff member who lives in the hostel who is an ass, everyone else is fine."
3,"Good party hostel, real close to the city center, and I'd recommend this ONLY if you are on a tight budget and want to socialize."
1,"."
1,"all night"
-1,"according to the price, I would say the overall quality is acceptable; if you're looking for cheap place for stay, I would recommend it"
1,"when i were sleeping somethings passed from my bed."
1,"."
-1,"approximately five minutes later again something passed."
1,"."
1,"After that i get up ad waited what is that ??"
-1,"And a mouse was walking around my bed... then i went to see the staff."
1,"."
-1,"i told this stuation and he said to me: - yes mouses are general problem at amsterdam."
1,"."
1,"only that :(((( i changed my bed to upper one :)"
-1,"hostel was too expensive for what it offers."
-1,"the blankets was too thin for cold weather."
2,"showers wasnt clean"
1,"if u look from another prespective 2 rooms with more then 15 people its hard to make it clean all the time."
2,"staff is really nice and tried to keep it clean."
1,"kitchen just have a microwave and refrigerator."
2,"location was good."
-1,"overall hostel is ok if u r staying for shorter time."
-1,"It would be awesome to have somewhat like a community room and thicker bedsheets."
1,"I was frozen after night."
-1,"You cannot call a kitchen the fridge and the microwave you have in the always..."
2,"very good."
-1,"The hot water didn't work."
-1,"The heat in the sleeping rooms appeared not to be working as well."
-1,"The credit card machine was not working when we tried to pay for our rooms."
-1,"only the location and price is good, if you just want to find a convenient place to sleep for one or two night at a very low price, it's ok."
-1," the hostel door is always open, which makes me feel insecured."
-1,"and most of the times, the room door and window is always closed, so the air inside the room is not fresh at all."
-1,"also, there's only a microwave and a fridge, which means almost impossible to cook."
1,""
-1,"what is above my expectation is that it's not noisy, even in the 20 mixed room."
-1,"The place is small and offers 20 bed dorms, so there are plenty of things that are to be expected with that."
2,"There are a lot of travelers and cool people to meet,"
1,"also people that stay up talking until 3am in the dorms."
2,"The staff is really cool too and are also young travelers that can give good advice."

-1,"Also the blankets are very thin,"
1,"at least the linen & towels are included."
2,"and it's warm enough inside actually."
-1,"This hostel says "drug-free" then why were there 3 people smoking bongs in the hallway to the lobby."
1,"."
-1,"Location- streets lines with prostitutes in windows."
1,"WStaff talking about what drugs to take to parties in the evening."
1,"."

-1," I booked a twin room which was on the sixth floor, with very steep narrow winding stairs this was a trek in itself!"
-1," All said, it is basic and a place to lay your head for the night, we rarely spent time in the room, and it is of a great location."
