2012-10-18, This Hostel is way to expensive and the staff is not really kind.
2011-05-05, It is not a special hostel, but it is ok to stay 2 or 3 days...
2009-05-14, TrueLove was a great place to stay, and Sean was very nice and extremely helpful!
2012-01-14, Great hostel. Shame It's a bit far from the center but great value for money.
2006-07-07, beautiful flat on the canal. bathroom lacked privacy, but all else was fantastic. highly recommended.
2006-10-10, has potential but most people just sit in the lobby too high to even talk all day...A bit sketchy at times.

2011-05-08, Very quite and beautiful place, best for taking a potion of fresh air, just 20 min from airport by bus.
2013-04-17, not too bad, just when I think about Amsterdam, It gives me royal pain in the ass.
2006-08-04, Way, WAY too much money for what I got. But then it is Amsterdam, so what can you do?
2006-03-13, the staff is very poor. other than that it was a lot of fun.
2012-10-07, The reception staff is very rude, and doesn't matter about your necessities.
2011-07-31, It is a party hostel.
2010-05-11, If you like camping you will love this place. Easy to get to from airport. Bus stop right in front

2006-08-01, Simple rooms short tram ride from the action. Great coffeeshop called greenhouse nearby.
2010-05-02, Very good looking, cheap and clean but far away from the centre of Amsterdam.
2007-11-25, Slightly further from the town centre than expected, but in the long run this proved to be a benefit.
2009-07-25, Very nice place. I would definetly go back again! The stuff was awesome!!!
2013-06-22, Very good hostel, perfect location and helpful staff, quite cheap. Thanks =)
2013-05-10, A really nice and clean place, just too little bathroom facilities.
2006-07-04, The rating will be much higher if the fees would be smaller...no good ratio quality/price

2010-07-13, Very big, very comfortable, great location, great staff, very safe, good bathroom... The best possible place of the whole of Amsterdam!
2011-10-13, Lovely apartment but sofas and bedding needs sorting eg double mattress on four poster and a sofa bed in front room , some modern lamps , and a bigger Telly . sheets and towels need replacing go for darker colours other than that lovely
2010-07-07, Although our first impression was marred because the apartment was not cleaned when we arrived, even though it was two hours after check in time. We then had to wait two more hours before getting in. It was eventually cleaned and it was a very nice apartment.
2010-06-13, The internet connection is non-existent. The playstation does not work properly and there are no dvd movies. Other than all this, the flat is great!
2010-04-11, This apartment is situated in the perfect place, close to everything very clean very friendly staff.
2010-08-13, Had lots of fun, but don't expect to meet anyone else staying at the "hostel", as there is no common area or anything like that. The apartment we stayed in was great, nice bedrooms and bathroom, large living room with a stove, fridge, freezer, aircon and tv.
2010-03-01, Great location! Nice and clean apartment. Strongly recommend!
2010-06-20, Make sure you call them and give them the exact time you will arrive at the hostel. If you do not, you will be stuck outside searching for their phone number. Otherwise, it was a great place right in the heart of the red light district.
2010-02-09, Nice place. Good location. Would highly recommend.
2010-01-24, ALL WAS PERFECT!!!GREAT PLACE!!
2010-01-18, very cool place to stay.. would deff go back there! location is brill also!
2009-12-27, everything was perfect!
2010-06-23, Very centrally located in an old house by a canal in the very center of historic Amsterdam. The manager was most helpful. We had a comfortable three room apartment, very quiet, near all the things we wanted to see and near the railroad station. The only disadvantage was the strairs, typical of old Amsterdam. They were very steep but the manager helped us withour suitcases. A really good buy all in all' lots of atmosphere.
2010-02-07, Very good apartment. Great location, very clean and very central in the red light district. Would recommend highly and will be definetly going back to stay again soon. Great!
2009-12-16, great place, great hostel... great apartment... best place in amsterdan to be...
2010-03-31, Very nice owners, really nice apartment and the location could NOT be better. Its perfectly in the middle of going-out locations, coffee shops and shops in general. Will definately be returning in the near future.
2009-09-27, Thanks to Nick over there, everything was great!
2009-12-21, this was a fantastic, place to stay, sooo big and right in the middle of the red light district! EXCELLENT!
2009-07-17, Very cool apartment in Amsterdam. Mark was friendly, good tips. Best thing, place is close to everything!
2009-12-03, it is a very nice place to stay in amsterdam. the apartement is perfect, clean, excellent rooms, in the center of the city. you can go everywhere on foot. And, most of alla, it is not expensive, compearing to most of the hostels\r enjoy your stay!!
2006-07-21, A great experience to stay on a great boat like this. Great breakfast and nice staff.
2006-01-01, Very nice place to stay in a good location. The little extras made this place a treat.
2012-08-23, it's close to the center - very nice stuff - but very noise - because on 1 floore there is several night clubs/
2008-01-21, I had so much fun at this hostel, very crowded but great for lone travellers wanting to meet people.
2012-01-14, ALL WAS GOOD,BUT I MISS A LOCKERS IN THE ROOMS.
2007-06-01, Really great place, but it's super noisy, so be ready for that.
2010-07-14, Great hostel with very nice staff. Shower and toilet was a bit small and dirty, but whatever. Had a great stay!
2014-05-20, Unfortunately, it's extremely noisy. The room facing the street should have a better noise isolation or, at least, any isolation.
2009-03-06, Don't count to much on the "free kitchen use", it's both unequipped and dirty! Breakfast is good though...
2011-04-22, Would be nice to have more bathrooms for the 12-mixed room... or a system/schedule. Many mornings were delayed... But overall, very good. I was afraid because of some bad reviews I'd read, but it was definitely good to me!
2011-04-22, Nice&affordable; hostel, excellent location.
2009-02-03, not the best place, but not bad.it is ok for two nights.good location.
2007-04-18, Even after a few days, I still cannot think of a bad thing about the place. STAY HERE!! Awesome.
2006-04-10, It's very comfortable, and it's very close from everywhere. Enjoy Amsterdam, it´s a wonderfull city.
2011-06-09, very good location,in a secure street and full of shop,all you need is a few meters from your hostel,(market,tobacco,restaurantsetc etc)
2012-07-10, It was a great hostel experience with friendly staff and a chill atmosphere. Love you guys. Keep it up!\r From Steve from South Korea
2009-01-27, dirty bathrooms and shower and so so so little room. the breakfast is poor, but the staff is very helpfull
2010-07-07, Very good apartment and very nice staff. However, the location is a bit poor. The breakfast is very good.
2011-04-28, Super Standort! 5 Min. vom Bahnhof entfernt, mitten in der Stadt. Der Königinnentag war einfach genial :o)
2010-04-19, great place to stay if u have a large group.. owner dirk was a great guy and very helpful...
2009-12-14, The Staff were very friendly and helpfull with many issues.i had everything i needed during my stay.
2011-07-14, Very nice location, if you're planning to discover Amsterdam having a base in the city centre, its a good place to stay. The hostel really needs a common room!! All activity in the hostel is happening in the dorms (had to make sandwiches in my own bed). Mice on the floor in the dorm during the night...
2011-06-10, Owner forgot to wake me up for my train, nearly missed it
2007-08-16, Lovely guesthouse, very clean, good location. I would recommend this place to anyone & would definitely come back
2009-08-19, Its very graet hostel in amsterdam. SUPER Location near to museumplein. Good staff :)))
2013-03-30, I wouldn't stay there again
2013-03-07, the beds are very uncomfortable.
2013-04-27, bad experience. if you've got better choices, this one is not recommended.
2013-07-15, close from central station and the downtown area. You can travel anywhere on foot from here. I met 3 staffs and they were all kind. Not that clean but no bugs.
2012-08-05, They add extra people. O there are more people at once than what you paid for. There is no area to chill at. It is not clean. Only good things are wifi and location
2013-04-26, The facilities are all quite poor and the bed sheets even got holes on them. We are living on the fifth floor of the building, and they don't even have an elevator! I don't really even bother to describe the washing room and the shower. They couldn't even make sure that you could always have hot water to use!
2012-09-03, El lugar de la recepción es uncuarto oscuro súper chiquito. Nadie habla espaniol ni francés, así que es imposi le la ayuda o comunicarwe para lo indispensable. No hay ascensor y hay que subir, o bajar, cuatro pisos por las escaleras. No es recomendable, salvo por la cercanía a la estación central, y no es económico.
2012-01-26, best hostel in amsterdam !!!!
2011-12-16, It were mice!!!!\r And there is no kitchen, only a fridge and a microwaves!!!l
2009-06-25, Really awesome place, definitely worth every penny of it. It's so close to all the attractions, there's no need for public transportation at all!
2012-05-01, Lots of people for limited showers/toilets. Some of the toilets were broken or without a seat while we were there. Staff tried to keep it clean but perhaps over cleaned so the floors were always wet and therefore muddy. \r Lockers available as a positive and great location.
2012-05-17, It was a really nice place, two steps from the Red Light District. Staff was friendly and helpful. The worse part was the cleanliness : The cleaning lady wasn't really working hard and seemed drunk or something the few times I've seen her. I hope that at least my bed sheets were washed. The room was so dusty that my girlfriend mopped the floor.
2011-09-12, There was no common room but our room was very large so it was fine to hang out there. Some people did have to sleep wih mattresses on the floor
2011-09-02, Very expensive for a huge dormitory ( 20 people ) without kitchen bar or a common room. And as a dormitory of 20 people there were noise...
2012-10-16, Estuvimos en el dormitorio femenino de 10 camas, y muy bien.Pero otros amigos en los dormitorios comunes estuvieron bastante mal, mucho ruido, suciedad y frio.No hay zonas comunes,asi que casi nula interacción con otros huespedes.El personal regular, poco dominio del inglés en general.
2011-06-19, Perfect location and a perfect spot for the budget traveller :)
2011-06-14, really neat spot, the stairs will seem like nothing in a day or two
2013-05-24, Thin mattress & pillow, broken bathroom door, bad lamps, no plug, etc.\r What's really bad is the fact that through a door in the 10-bed female dorm I was in was an apartment for one of the guys that works in the hostel. No one even bothered to tell me this when I checked in, and it took two times going down to the desk to get an answer out of them. I understand that the building is old and sometimes things are set up that way, but YOU NEED TO TELL THE PEOPLE STAYING THERE. Do not stay here.
2011-06-12, Staff was very friendly tried to help the best way they can. Very safe and clean.
2011-07-13, Very uncomfortable beds, there were mice running around on the floor every night, and the staff didn't care. At one time there were at least 4 mice at the same time, in the same room. Also overall a bit shabby hostel. But location is great, and though it wasn't really cheap at all, it was the cheapest hostel we could find.
2011-09-12, There's no common area or kitchen (there is a small fridge and a microwave, I wish more hostel without a kitchen thought of that much so food dosn't get spoiled). The dorm kind of doubles as the common pre drinks party area which is fine I had no trouble sleeping either night but I think that might be a sign how tired I was. generally anywhere with a bed and a shower free WiFi is great. I really enjoyed my time in this hostel
2011-06-06, We stayed in the 20-bed room. Others in the room were decently respectful of others' sleep. The showers were very nice, the toilets smelled a bit, but were otherwise fine. There is someone at the front desk at all times besides when they lock the doors from 4am to 6am. We really enjoyed the weird charm of this place. Very nice for the price.
2011-05-26, Everything was fine except for a couple mice we saw running around the dorm room.
2011-05-24, nearly no kitchen there\r picture on webpage don´t schow the truth
2011-06-10, This is by far the worst hostel I've stayed in. It's a large 20 bed room that smells awful. The staff doesn't care about anything.\r The hostel has a lookout of 4am-6am which can stink if you're out late partying. It is extremely noisy in the room from street traffic because you within eye view of some of the Red Light District. Highly recommend against
2011-05-19, The staff at Aivengo was extremely nice and accommodating! It was exactly what I expected for a hostel and my friends and I really had a good experience.
2011-05-17, The female room, with 10 beds, is very good. Clear, clean, with big windows. The only problem is that it is on the 5th floor, and there isnt a lift. The bed is not so comfortable. The location is good, the staff are friedly. I recomend it :)
2011-05-16, My stay at this hostel was ok. It is pretty close to all the action. The dorms are kinda stinky and so are the blankets. The showers and bathrooms were pretty clean. Dont leave anything valuable out. I got my i-pod stolen from off my bunk while I was sleeping. Overall it was ok.
2011-06-07, There was a mouse in the room!!! But apart from that the location is great, I thought it was going to be akward sleeping with 18 more people, but at night it was really quiet and you could sleep with no prob. The bathrooms are clean, but its part of the general common area (so everyone can see you brushing your teeth). We didnt have any security problems, in general de Hostel was good for just 2 nights.
2011-05-14, The bathroom was clean and new. However we had to go trough the lobby from the room. I also disliked the fact that the staff almost got my stuff on the floor because i was 10 min off the check-out hour. I guess they're on hurry to make more money.
2011-05-15, this hostel is not good, too dark, and feel insecure, the staff is indifferent, and not helpful at all. the room is also dark and not clean :(
2011-05-08, staffs there are really nice and room is clean
2011-05-12, We stayed in a douple private ensuite and the room was amazing. Nothing to complaint about it. The room was big, had a balcony, the bathroom was also big and had a jacuzi!!! Although the room was in the 6th floor, without a lift, the view worthwhile. \r The hostel's entrance don't look so clean, they need to work on that.
2011-05-17, Good security lockers, good security in general. Great staff! Very nice and helpful. Great location as well. Very near the train station and easy walking to everywhere else. No lounges to hang out in, and seeing as my friend and I would come back with food late at night, wanting to talk and play cards or something, we wanted some sort of a lounge room. Sheets were a little beat up, kinda gross to sleep on.
2011-05-12, Improve ventilation system in the bedrooms; put good curtains in the bedrooms; fix another computer; change check out to midday.
2011-05-04, For a female dorm we sure had a male in our room... it is a problem
2011-04-26, I booked a twin room in this hostel, and i was with a friend. We really liked the room, which is simple but sufficient for two nights. Perhaps one disadvantage; up the six floors ahah! We recommend this hostel for those who go down in amsterdam. Great price and located next to the train station and centrum!\r Have a good trip !
2011-04-20, Excellent location.
2011-04-28, A good hostel, next to the centraal station. Clean showers and rooms. No problems to sleep even at the queens night.good computer acces.\r Problems: 1_ small lockers 2_no common room 3_ No USb entrace in computers or printers\r If you cant stay in voldelpark, i would stay in aivengo
2011-04-23, This hostel is in a good location. However, all this place has is beds and bathroom. No place to hang out and chill, or to socialise. From what I hear about other hostels in Amsterdam, I can only recommend this place if all others are full, which they were when I booked.
2011-04-16, very big rooms, noisy roommates will ruin your sleep, but not the hostels fault. very good overall. mattress is thin and poked me through it but I could still sleep.
2011-04-07, Great location but very gross beds and bathrooms. It was not unbearable but I would strongly advise against staying here.
2011-04-05, It would be better if there's place to hang clothes. \r The side that we stayed at has poor/nil wifi connection.
2011-04-10, I spend at Aivengo 2 nights and I only have very good memories. The room was spacious and the bed comfortable, a young & tall Dutch guy at the reception extremely kind and helpful with everything. My best experience with hostels ever!
2011-04-03, besides the crazy walk to get to the room (6 flights!), everything was pretty good. main guy at the front desk was super nice and helpful.
2011-03-31, The beds were very uncomfortable. Staff were good. Free internet terminals were good. Drinking in rooms was allowed which was good. Showers were good although started to run out of hot water if too many people used them
2011-03-26, if you find something better, go for it!!!
2011-03-30, Stayed in the female dorm for 5 nights. The bed wasn't very comfy. By 'kitchen' they mean a fridge and a microwave. And it's a 12-bed instead of 10-bed dorm. The rent is rather cheap on weekdays.
2011-04-03, We stayed at the top floor (5th) and we ended up crawling up to the top every night. However we enjoyed every step of it. Hostel was well lovely and clean, in a perfect location. I had an amazing time in amsterdam and I highly recommend this hostel! - very cheap as well :)
2011-04-22, So, If you wanna stay there, I recommend. Good location, near the central station and to the tourist attractions of the center of the city. You can also rent a bike and do a tour through the nice city bikeways! The hostel has rooms on the ground floor and one more on the 4th floor. I stayed in this last one and I had a little difficult with the many stairs and two keys that we need to use to enter the room ( you have to consider that Amsterdam it's a freak out city). But the room was nice, safe, clear and b
2011-03-21, Everything was great, if you don't mind a stray bug, and climbing 5 sorries on small round steps.
2011-03-23, The location of the hostel is excellent and thats it. Beds like in jail, mice instead of sockets in the room and the hostel closes the doors from 4 to 6 am and doesnt let people in. As all clubs close at 3.30 this can be pretty inconvenient. Apart from that its a nice place to stay because of the location and the good prices during the week.
2011-03-18, The staff was very friendly, but I would never stay here again. The hostel was noisy, crowded, unsafe, and rather dirty.
2011-05-04, The location of the hostel is excellent, only 5 minutes from the central station, 5 or so min to the Red Light District and Dam Square! The only downside is I was in the 5th floor and the stairs are soo steep I got dizzy everytime going up and down...Cleaning could have been better, the cleaning lady only changed the sheets, but didn't clean the bathroom or replenish the toilet paper for my whole stay!
2011-03-25, Didn't look much like the pictures shown on their website. Originally freaked out because we booked an all female dorm, and it is not located on the first floor where you check in, but we didn't realize this while waiting in line! Thankfully, the all female dorm is located up 4 flights of steep stairs which provides another layer of security! Definitely a great location so close to Centraal Station and all the trams. We walked EVERYWHERE which compensated for our consumption of french fries and waffle coo
2011-03-10, Blankets smelled and the bathrooms smelled awful. The drains in the shower don't drain.
2011-03-18, Aivengo Hostel was unique and a good hide-away. The room we stayed in was nice, and cleanliness was better than many hostels I've stayed at. Staff was awesome- fun and friendly.
2011-03-16, Would have been great if there's a common place for everyone to hangout. No complaints though since location is very good and its a value for money place. Free wifi is available and staff are very friendly.
2011-03-26, AWESOME location- 5 minute walk from the train station and close to the center of town. Tram stations are just around the corner to get to the museumplein as well. Rooms were clean, but the bed I was assigned to was broken on one end and when i first sat down on it the mattress fell through... There was a fridge and microwave in our room which was great because there is no breakfast. Towels are provided and the showers were hot. Overall- would definitely stay there again!
2011-03-03, Excellent Location. 10 Min walk from Amsterdam Central Station. In the heart of entertainment and tourist attraction. The dorm was a bit cold, bring your sleeping bag.
2011-03-01, Well I was fine with the hostel until I saw the mice running under my bed. Then we discovered a mouse trap under my friend's bed so the hostel clearly already knew about the problem, but nothing was said. Also the light was out by our corner so I could never see anything. We basically tried to spend as much time as possible out of the hostel.
2011-02-28, One thing that the hostel might want to think about is installing a proper lock on the door to the storage room, just removing the door knob isn't all that secure.\r \r Thanks for a great stay, the staff was really nice and made our trip a pleasure!
2011-10-16, The 4th floor room is really cosy and nice. The stuff was very friendly, specially the Check. Republic guy, Vratislav, he is really helpfull and friendly all the time. Thank you very much!!!!!!
2011-03-05, We had booked four beds in a 10-bed dorm for girls, but it there were actually 12 beds in there. The beds were somewhat uncomfy and it was quite cold during the night, but we didn't mind. Just bring warm pyjamas :) Also taking your own towel with you might be a good idea, because the provided towel can be very small (some of them were bigger than the others). There's a fridge, toaster, water boiler and a microwave in the kitchen. There also was a stove but the sign said that it's not usable for safety reaso
2011-01-20, Bella camera in posizione tranquilla ma in centro,stupenda veduta dalle finestre,anche un balcone...Reception disponibile e cortese! +++++
2011-01-21, perfect location close to the main train station, right on the cusp of the red light district, there are three 'çoffee shops' within a 100m walk...
2011-01-13, My bed's sheets were ripped in half, but other than that a pleasant stay in a safe environment
2011-01-03, Staff was friendly, location was great! Kudos to the provided towel.
2011-01-20, First, Aivengo is very close to the Central station in Amsterdam which is great when you oversleep for your flight. Second, the cleanliness was to a high standart and staff was very helpful as well. You will not regret.
2011-03-07, the hostel was clean and the room we were in (all-girls room) was great, loft-like and had a fridge and a microwave for out own food. only problem was that the shower was in the same room as the sinks so when someone was showering we didn't dare go get water etc. and there was no sink in the toilet. at nights it was a bit cold so if your travelling in the winter/late autumn/early spring and have difficulties sleeping when it's not so warm, you should bring a sleeping bag because the blankets weren't too thi
2011-01-07, The double ensuite was a nice, spacious room with great views. We had our own little balcony and a nice bathroom. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience. Would stay there again in the future!
2010-12-28, 5 minutes from the train station which was really nice. friendly staff. cheapest hostel i found. 11 euro for Dec 28th and 29th
2011-01-02, most of the staff seemed cranky and unhelpful. it was very clean but the whole vibe of the hostel was a place to sleep at night, not hang out and meet other travelers.
2012-11-23, i´ve been there many times and i love it every time when i come back!! :-)
2011-01-02, when they say there is a kitchen i would take that word very lightly. the "kitchen" was comprised of a microwave, a non working stove and fridge. on the positive side the hostel is really close to everything in amsterdam; no more then a 30min walk to where you need to go
2010-12-06, The decoration of the reception was very unique and beautiful. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The location is excellent, just a few minutes walk from centraal station, the red light district, the anne frank house, china town, the jordaan. I will definitely recommend this hostel to many more friends and family.
2011-03-05, El sitio parecia un local de fiesta que lo habian convertido en hostal, y con esto me refiero a que solo había un espacio común donde estaba el dueño y un sofa.\r \r Las habitaciones eran dos cuartos enormes y por lo menos en el que a mí me tocó la pared que daba a la calle era una puerta de madera con una cristalera enorme tapada con una manta, podeis imaginaros el frio que hacía, por si eso fuera poco no teniamos nórdicos, solo una simple manta para taparnos y la sábana de la almohada no las cambiab
2013-03-01, First visit to Amsterdam.Greeting by staff member was very informative, map provided. Our room was comfortable and clean, with an ensuite shower room that was adequate. There was a newly refurbished kitchen/relaxation room\r that proved to be a perfect meeting place. We got to know other travellers. Our room was comfortable and located in a 300 year old building, but we had 70 stairs to climb to get to it.
2013-03-09, our room was on the uppest floor and the last day we remarked that there is a big kitchen and living room to share but no one told us this on the reception the first day. would be great if we could get the general info from the beginning.But anyway the staff were very nice.
2013-11-11, Mixed reactionreallyu. Mattress was super duper thin that you can fell the metal bars of the bed. But they propped additional new mattresses on the old ones after a few days. It did help. But no kitchen to cook, only a microwave n kettle in the ladies dorm. No common room to mix n mingle with the rest. Not very friendly nor helpful staff. I tried to book a room for my return journey for one night and they told me to do it online, even when I was standing there at the reception.
2012-10-19, a nice experience on the whole, especially with my countryman/"related nationalities" on the staff.\r \r Having spent my summer holidays in India, I do not consider 30 euros/night in a dorm a " good value for money":). But this is Amsterdam, right?:)
2012-10-08, Het was een prima hotel om te vertoeven. Hoewel ik niet gewend was aan slaapzalen verliep alles heel goed. Het is prettig dat er wat keukenapparatuur aanwezig is. Nog wel een paar adviezen. De vloer zou mogelijk een keer vervangen kunnen worden. Er zouden mogelijk kleine wandjes tussen de bedden staan. Ipv dekens zou men misschien beter dekbedhoezen uitdelen. Mogelijk kan de prijs voor de week en het weekend hetzelfde blijven. Een investering aangezien de locatie Spuistraat heel prettig is.
2013-01-02, Unfortunately I have to say that the room we stayed in was very dirty and there was no window in it which made the place not so comfortable for our stay. Location was very central and therefore very convenient, but the lack of air and light plus was a negative point, I'm afraid. Also, floors were very dirty.
2010-12-17, I was raped.
2012-02-05, The reception wasnt open at all during our stay so no contact with them at all after check in. The room was at top of 5 flights of stairs with no discernable fire exit!! Walls paper thin so had to listen to the couple next door bonking every night!!!!! good location but wouldnt re-book.
2014-03-25, it was clean and near center i recommend it definitely
2012-07-18, We had our own twinshare room which suited us fine. The room had an ensuite and was on the top floor up extremely steep and narrow stairs, which made it a little difficult to get our bags up and down. We are not aware of any kitchen facilities available, but then we didn't look for them. We found our stay very comfortable, and the little contact we had with management was pleasant. The beds were clean and comfortable with fresh sheets, pillows and a doona supplied.
2011-09-25, Walking up 4 flights of stairs with my suitcase almost gave me a heart attack! The room was cute but kinda set up like a concerntration camp. The beds were squeeky, very old and the floor would of been better to sleep on. However the location and the great staff made up for it, and after space cake, didn't care where I slept. Give it a 6/10
2014-02-14, My only issue was the moutain of narrow and steep stairs to get to our room.\r \r 6floors of spiral like stairs are a killer to climb when ur rather tipsy ;-)
2013-11-29, This hostel is centrally located, safe and incredibly spacious (I miss my bed there in female loft room!). The staff are helpful and efficient, thank you to all. Highly recommended.
2013-10-20, Really cool hostel and great value for money. Quite quiet, no party vibe. I found it very comfortable and the staff were all lovely and helpful and friendly.
2013-09-04, I had planned to stay @ the Bulldog hotel, but decided on the cheapest hostel in Amsterdam, which is across the road from a Bulldog coffeeshop. For the price, it is really worth it & I will be making it my place to stay in Holland.
2013-08-31, I felt very confortable and in a happy atmosphere. I would only suggest to add at least a plug beside each bed. \r The private bathroon is something to highlight as a strong point, as well as the lockers.\r The staff was very nice, specially the guy during the day, that gave me also information about the city.
2013-08-07, Was at the 5th floor! Steep narrow stairs going up! The shower area has no additional lights and was rather dark if you showered at night...
2013-06-17, insuffient facilities
2014-05-09, it wasn´t what I expected... the facilities can be bad, I can handle that, but I don´t know what is wrong with the staff, maybe they were too tired, because they were not bad, but they weren´t friendly at all...
2010-12-30, I loved this hostel. I stayed in a 10-bed dorm. I expected bunk beds and a small amount of space per person, but it was a big room with plenty of space, wooden floor with a big window where the daylight came through, kitchen with working toaster and microwave, fridge and freezer, and lockers for valuables were included in the price, located right in the room. The guy at the front desk was kind of grumpy but he did his job.
2013-04-17, The hostel is not far from central station and easy to find. The 4 bed family room with bath room and toilet is separated from hostel and located at Saint Jacobbstraas. We satisfied with the officer and room comparing its price. The family room we stayed was on the first flloor and there was nusance from the second floor to disturbe us during sleeping.
2013-04-07, good hostel and good location. easy to get to everywhere you want.\r \r free internet. but rare toilet and bathroom.
2013-06-08, I wouldve expected better for 35euros a night for a 8 bed dorm.. No door to bathroom which is an ensuite, so midnight, 6am when people r showering its not exactly quiet.. Kitchenette really is just a fridge & microwave, no bench.. No common areas, so to meet others is in your room.. I did have a comfy bed & there is very good wifi connection & staff were really friendly, I just think that 35euros was far too much...
2013-04-04, so nice to stay there.\r great value of money\r nice stuff \r will help you in everything
2013-08-12, It was the worst hostel so far. The room was dirty most of the time and there is a small fridge and some appliances for the guests to prepare their own food which is really fine, but it was necessary to wash the dishes in the sink of the bathroom. It really annoyed me.
2013-03-29, I was really gald with the service and location , could not be better, thanks !
2012-10-23, A very nice hostel, no complaints and value for money Many Thanks
2012-10-18, Good hostel, good kitchen, and TV, but bloody u have to climb 6 floors with out lift and with all your luggage, that was the real pity,,,,,
2012-06-15, Most of the people in this hostel is the noisiest in the world. It is not fault of the staff, but it would be good they speak to these people for them to respect their roomates when all the people sharing the room complain. This incident aside, it is an average place to stay, well located, very near the Central Station.
2012-05-25, Lacks a common area and a kitchen properly... that is not IN the bathroom. I think you should use one of the rooms below for this purpose, one is forced to spend all day outside and you can not meet people who are staying with us in the hostel.
2012-04-12, Very close to Central station. I will stay there again!!Thanks
2012-04-20, I would say that this hostel is the worst hostel I have ever stay. \r cold bed room. thin blankets, towels are a bit better than rag.\r no kitchen in the female dorm, the so-called "kitchen" is in another building has only one dirty small bowl+ a microwave + few plastic forks & spoon.\r only location of the dorm was acceptable.\r I would never comeback to this hostel again.
2012-04-06, This may be cheaper than other hostels in Amsterdam but it's atrocious - avoid like the plague if you want peace and quiet
2012-04-05, The only good thing about this hostel it's the location.\r There were lockers but no keys to use them and the staff didn't care at all. The beds were extremely unconfortable, the room and the bathroom was not very clean. The price was too high for the quality of the services.
2012-03-30, A little cold. Hostel closes its doors after 4 am. Security door to each room but staff will let people in who don't stay there!!
2011-12-15, nice location,cheap!a bit noisy but for 20beds room it s normal!with the help of smoke u will sleep perfectly!!!
2011-12-27, The pros:\r 1. Centrally located.\r 2. Rooms seemed quite clean.\r 3. Loved the bright colors of walls +blankets/beddinings.\r The cons:\r 1. Hostel computers constantly out of order.\r 2.Beds make an awful lot of noise everytime you turn sides.\r 3. Shower rooms impractical and claustrophobic. Shower curtains slimy.\r 4. Toilets need be cleaned oftener.\r 5. No luggage safety room (only a small locker)\r 6. The small fridge,micro wave and kettle are bt the toilet and shower rooms...Not hygienic!\r But ok! 10€/nigh
2013-04-02, too bad the lockers are so small and the lock to the dorm room was not working...
2011-10-20, The description of this hostel on the website is flattering.It was all very average; while there is nothing strictly wrong with the hostel, i can't think of anything good about it either. Definitely smelly and only three showers/toilets for 30+ people. But it was one of the cheaper options so i mustn't complain too much.
2011-10-09, The hostel is very well located but the facilities are really poor . There is only one sheet in the bed, the bed is uncomfortable and finally we found two mice beside my bed!. There
2011-09-13, The staff are always helpful and friendly. The hostel is located at a close distance to the touristique area. The price is very economical.
2011-07-09, The fact that the hostel is closed between 4-6 in unacceptable
2011-08-17, The blankets were not changed, what is unsanitary. You sleep in the same blanket that another person slept the night before.
2011-03-14, NiCe =)) Very friendly staff at the hotel. Excellent location. The only thing that I didn't like were the showers.
2013-04-12, Staff not very polite, atmosphere of the hostel cold,people don't speak to others maybe caused by the poor places (2 big room of 20 beds,1 bath room without door, just some WC and showers about 5 of each), I feel myself there like spending time in a train station hall.In bath better wearing shower shoes. In bed, sleep with my clothes due to a bed feeling from the cleanliness of it...Sunday morning, staff open room door & lights at 9, sorry for people who wants to sleep...Near station,red light
2011-04-15, The most rude and uncharming staff I have ever met in a hostel, and I have travelled a lot! The room was clean but small located on the 6th floor. That could really be a problem if you have much luggage as the staff doesn't help carrying it in the narrow steep stairs. The man checking us in couldn't count and was hesitant about the balance we should pay. Due to this when checking out I was ripped off the 10 euro-deposit I paid upon arrival. I wouldn't recommend this hostel to anyone!
2014-06-25, Staff was very nice! No problema with lines to use the bathroom even considering the enourmous bedroom! They have just one plug to charge the whole room! So it's a dispute to find one to charge your eletronic devices. Besides that I recommend the hostel!! Very good
2014-01-03, Passed through this hostel a few times before, always found it a good place to stay, beds were very clean and fresh and showers are good also, discovered they had an upstairs part of the hostel this time which was smaller than the main part of the building, you'll also notice there are these massive beams which appear to take the weight of the structure of the buildings it's possible these are the same as when they were originally constructed back in 1630. Nice place, Would recommend.
2014-05-28, Overall a good place to stay.... Clean and safe. Good location and the bar nextdoor is cool Staff were not overly friendly but were by no means rude either.
2011-01-27, i stayed in the 20 person dorm for three nights. it is on the ground floor and just beside the reception(not in another building). hence i didnt have to use any stairs for upper floors. there are stairs on bunks. it is not an expensive hostel. no bed bugs. no mouse. there is wifi and two laptops ready for internet. staff is helpful. they give you map. there isnt a large lounge for socializing. no party or entertainment. a very thin blanket on beds. it is sometimes cold inside. i recommend it.
2014-05-24, The location was good, very central and easy accessible. Staff was polite. The toilets were rather small and inconvenient. The cleanliness is a bit of an issue, the sheets and pillow weren't washed. It's a good deal if you don't care about the above, and just need a place to sleep.
2014-05-29, There is a room which is very big and close to the street, so depending on your bed it is very noisy.\r The bed is also very bad, there is a tube in the middle of it so you can feel it even with the mattress when you are sleeping.\r The baths are cleaned constantely so they are very clean. The shower is aslo private (there is a door for each shower and each bathroom).\r The location is good because it is very close to the central station.
2014-05-17, everything are good except that we live a street apart from the hostel. There are no curtain for the inner door so the neighbor can actually look inside the room when they going upstairs. no hair dryer as well. the room was very cold (colder than outside) but there are no heater available according to the staff? overall is a good stay, and we enjoy the city very well.
2014-04-28, Just 2 electric sockets in room for 20 people :(
2014-05-20, The mattresses are all sagged in the middle and not very comfortable because you can feel the frame under you. They really need to get new mattresses. The bed sheets are also not very breathable. The place has a pretty bad atmosphere, only come here to sleep for cheap. The bathrooms are not great, extremely tiny, and the common bathroom area is where people hang out so you end up doing your makeup with everyone watching, but at least there is hot water.
2014-05-23, the stay was horrible! it started with climbing stairs: 5 floors with heavy luggage. After that the room looked more like a prison cell: beds with bars that made noise++. the floor dirty;it was supposed to be reserved for girls but we had in every morning and evening a guy crossing the room(they were part of the staff)One day it rained(a little) and the roof was not sealed! results : beds and belongings were wet! the only two positive points of the hotel: location and staff: nice and helpfull
2014-04-24, Rooms with bad ventilation. The cushions have a V format, maybe they should need to be changed. But it´s very good located and fair price.
2014-04-18, The hostel was good but it was really expensive considering it was quite old. The booking requirement for minimum of 3 nights even though I stayed only 2 nights was unfair. Hence I had to pay for extra night which made no sense.
2014-04-21, Very good hostel for the price. Clean and I loved the individual beds. Never felt worried for my stuff.\r The only thing it may be improved is to have a door in the showers so people can sleep without being bother with the noise.
2014-04-12, I found the bed comfortable the staffers helpful and it's in a good location.
2014-04-08, Nice place, basic but exactly what you would expect for the price
2014-04-03, Excellent location, nice view from the 4th floor!!
2014-04-16, The location is great. However, the hostel is a bit old. There is no lounge area. I stayed in the female dorm and the shower was a bit crowded in the morning since there were more than 8 of us but just one shower. My bed was not close to any plugs. \r The staff was very kind and friendly.
2014-03-21, We were a group of ten friends and we stayed all together in the female dorm. It is a large room, good beds and really warm enough and clean. The staff was very nice and helpful. The only problem was the shower: it isn't very big and we had some problems with hot-cold water (it was too hot or too cold). We had a really nice time here!
2014-03-14, We stayed in a 10 bed girls doorm. Big room, no bunkbeds. Unfortunately they put two extra girls in there over the weekend so we were 12 girls, sharing only one Bathroom. There's no extra bathrooms in the building, unless you go to the reception area.\r Other than that it was okay, only five minutes from central station and walking distance to pubs etc.\r Would come back.
2014-04-03, I stayed in the female dorm which is quite spacey and the beds are comfortable (you also have a small kitchen with a kettle and a microwave oven here).However, it´s kinda separated from the hostel and lack any atmosphere - no common room, the only time I have seen the staff was during check in and check out. I also have a feeling that the room was not cleaned during my stay (3 nights).We even have to remove sheets from our beds when we were leaving which is something I think the staff should do.
2014-02-07, Few toilets for so many people.\r Not so well located as I thought.
2014-02-06, Your Hostel is very nice, but the shower in room B under the roof doesn't work properly. Someone should take care of this.
2013-12-27, It will be great to organize some (night) activities promoted by the hostel
2013-12-04, I had a great experience staying here, I would definitely choose the same place for my next trip to Amsterdam. It's very cheap and good enough for the value of the money.
2012-08-18, we stayed in 20 mixed dorm first night which was great, the rest two nights we have been moved to female dorms which was just amazing!location-couldn't be better, staff-friendly, helpful, overall: I shall see you very soon!
2014-03-14, This was one of the cheapest hostels in Amsterdam and I was definitely happy to choose it - overall it was a good experience. The room (in the building next door) was spacious and comfortable, there's not a lot of privacy when getting in and out of the shower though (due to shared sink area and outlook into the room) but it seemed to work anyway. Good facilities in room - fridge/freezer, microwave, dishes, lockers etc and towel was included. Helpful staff. Would recommend if on a budget.
2013-11-23, very nice place. great location! nice and helpful staff. hot water and comfortable bed, that is all one need..
2013-11-03, Great hostel, best in this city.
2013-11-15, They where really nice to me they help me a lot with some issues that i had and also hostel is really good located!! You wont find something like that for the price! hope to see you soon!
2013-11-01, 4 flights of stairs up to the room wasn't ideal with a suitcase. The room was so full they put mattresses of the floor for extra guests so there was 12 in and 10 person room. Very hot and stuffy in the room. If u just want some where to sleep it will do but not worth staying there if u want comfort or good atmosphere...
2013-10-28, The hostel is near the central station as well as the red light district and other popular spots. This is the best thing about it. The staff is nice and they have discount cards to some establishments. The only downsides are 1. There's no lift, and we stayed at the topmost floor, so lugging around our stuff was quite tiring. 2. The wifi fluctuated. The signal is not strong in the room; even in the common room it's pretty weak.
2014-05-22, i spent a long weekend in amsterdam by myself and was very satisfied with aivengo! central (=not quiet during night) location & nice staff! i slept in a dorm with 9 other girls on the 3rd or 4th floor next door to the actual hostel. there was one bathroom for us, but it sufficed and was cleaned every day. my bed was comfortable and there were enough sockets for everyone. i received a locker against a 10€ deposit payment (reimbursed upon departure). the stove is not in use due to safety reasons.
2013-10-25, Nice little twinroom at the top floor. \r The stairs are pretty doable (it's 6 floors but it won't kill you UNLESS you travel with lots of luggage).\r Bathroom cleaned, linen ok (you'll get bathtowels for free at private rooms), just don't expect for a high quality mattress! Nice view from the shared kitchen.\r Really great location, safe for solo travelers , and easy to get to. Staff was ok (not the smiliest people in the world), although they'll provide you whatever info you ask and a city map.
2013-10-18, Not a bad place, to stay a night or two. Could replace the blankets with something warmer. The guy at reception was really friendly and helpful.
2013-10-23, Location is excellent... :) But, the stay would have much better if it has a good mattress, a blanket with cover and of course some extra socket plugs. There were just two socket plugs for 20 people and you can imagine how late night you need to stay just to charge your mobile/laptop. :(
2013-09-27, The hostel is very well located, the staff is friendly and helpfull.\r The only inconvenient is that there is no elevator and the are too many floor with rooms. I had to go up to the 5th floor with may baggage and it wasn't easy.
2014-02-21, Location: the hostel is 5 minutes walking from the central station + you can reach all main attractions by walking. \r Staff: The girl at check-in was kind and nice. But the guy at check out was very rude + we couldn't leave our luggage as promised\r We booked a 4-beds room with private bathroom, that was not in the same building (but very close to it though)\r The room was very basic furnished (2 bunk beds, a dirty sofa) at ground floor, no windows, and a tiny washbasin.
2013-09-18, was very nice...
2013-10-20, This is my favorite hostel. Wifi is fast (versus non-existent you would find elsewhere), it's a short walk from train station, the main sales point for me was the quality of people are far superior than what you will find elsewhere irregardless of price in this town.
2013-09-14, very average hostel but for a reasonable price. need to bring a blanket as what they provide is a very thin fleece blanket that isn't long enough to cover taller person's feet. Good location and cheap so was happy with the hostel and would go back.
2008-08-02, in the rooms there wasn't 6 beds but 8!!!one of this was on the floor and it was too dirty!!
2013-08-30, Literally just a bed/shower and toilet in the city (no kitchen, no common room) very disappointing. That said however very clean nice big rooms (although lack of power points in the place). There is also a curfew which would have been nice to know so don't have many late nights. good location but there are better hostels out there.
2013-10-04, A pretty basic hostel, an inexpensive no frills place to sleep in a good location. Easy to get to from the main train station, and then easy to get from here to all of the action. Absolutely no common room to meet people, and the people in the dorms don't seem like they're there to meet fellow travelers. If you're already with a group of friends and don't need to meet people, its a pretty good option considering its affordability and quality of cleanliness/facilities.
2013-09-19, Easily the worst hostel I have stayed at in 4 months of European travel. It is rather cheap for Amsterdam, but the 20 bed dorm legitimately looked like hospital ward, there was no kitchen and no common area whatsoever. Staff also allowed 2 guys in who grabbed a group of peoples phones that were on charge and then stole them. The only place to hang out was in the hospital dorm or hallway. Extremely disappointing, kinda ruined my time in Amsterdam.
2013-07-30, we had the double room - private bathroom and it was amazing. this made us forget the fact that the room was not ready at 12am.
2013-08-13, Overall it's an okay place, the staff are kind and they maintain it well. Showers are warm, lots of washrooms. \r \r I felt the lack of a kitchen was a big drawback (there is only a microwave and a bar fridge) and also a lack of common space - there aren't really any good areas to just hang out with people. Also sleeping in a 20 bed dorm is quite the experience - bring your earplugs! And they don't have anywhere to store luggage.\r \r In the end, location is fantastic though, and price is right.
2013-06-30, I really enjoyed my staying in Aivengo hostel. It almost became my home for this 2 weeks) When I return to Amsterdam, I would like to stay there again.
2013-07-05, i do not recommend booking this hostel.\r 1. they wrote,their free wifi will work in all their rooms - no, it didn´t work!\r 2. there is no privacy. no door in the bathroom,so that all the rest 9 girls in your room watch you drying yourself with a towel,or you must do it in a 1x1m shower cabin, cleaning the walls with your towel. \r 3. the staircase up is horrible especially if you have a suitcase.\r 4. a man-worker was walking through our room every day 2 times without nocking.\r 5.not 35e worth!
2013-06-17, A very friendly crew...plus the location is perfect near by Ams central/main station
2013-07-11, The staff is very unfriendly, you have to pay for towels,housekeeping was poor, the bathrooms are tiny and if you´re cold at the night you can´t ask for another extra blanket because the manager doesn´t feel like doing it. If you only want to stay a few days in the city it´s ok but if you´re thinking to stay more than three days isn´t worth it.
2013-06-11, The lockers in the room are unsafe, two of my room mates lost cash and one room mate lost her credit card on the first day I arrive. Too many people able to access the rooms, other than the ten ladies staying in it. No sense of security.
2013-05-31, Toilet seats with lids would be nice, a staff member could have been friendlier, some warmer blankets could have helped. Lacked atmosphere.
2013-06-06, Only complaint is bathroom: 1 bathroom, 12 bed female dorm is shocking. Needs separate shower area from sink/toilet so more than one person can use at one time. Shower was also EXTREMELY dirty. Soap/dirt build up around bottom of tub made me cringe. Guy came every morning to change the garbage & barely mop down the floor (basically soak up water), why couldn't he wash the tub? Took 3 days to replace handsoap. Had to ask for top bed sheet (not provided). Decent price, good location, nice staff!
2013-06-20, The place was located in a good place, about 5-10 mins walk to AMS central station and 15-20 minutes away from the red light district and 30 mins walk to Vondelpark, 15 mins to Westergasterras. I liked the place however the lobby was really small....was hoping to interact with other backpackers but was cooped in the room instead. My bed was great, all beds were individuals, no bunk beds. There's a cute balcony (really french doors) and you can look out on Spuistraat. Thanks for the great time.
2013-05-17, The Hostel was a real nightmare. We spent 3 nights in a 10-Femal-Dorm. Nevertheless there have been 11 beds in the room and just one bathroom. The sheets were dirty and the beds were old, squeaky and uncomfortable. The whole place was dirty (especially the bathroom) and the staff seemed to be drunk and confused. Only the location was excellent. It's located right in the middle of Amsterdam, only 5 min away from the train station. But still I would never recommend this hostel to anyone.
2013-05-16, I dont how how its possible to this place be acceptable as a ''youth hostel''.. The place is not cleaned enough.Toilets are a bit old. .Also there is no toilet seats in the toilet.yes!. The mattress is thin than a paper so I was on the top of a bunk bed and the bed bar hit my back, thats ridiculous. you wont be able to sleep in this hostel. there are no facilities at all.. thumbs up for the location though
2013-05-07, Only one bathroom ( wc inside!!) for a "10 beds" room.\r We were not sure that they clean the bathroom and room every day. \r the staff was just 'correct'.
2013-05-18, Well the staff is no te very nice, they just don't care, the rooms are good but they need to have lights for each bed not one for the entire room, the wc is unbelievable small !! and they need calefaction or better mantles. I will think twice before returning. however it is a good value for money.
2013-04-27, Had an awesome time here. Staff were great. Beds were fine. Good social vibe.
2013-04-26, great staff, fantastic location, highly recommended!!
2013-08-12, I thought this place was great! It was much more then what i expected for my money, clean, good, helpful staff and we were lucky that we were with nice people, even if we had our own double room :) Location right next to train station, 7 min walk from food plaza, bars everywhere. Perhaps a lot of stairs, but heck, it is Amsterdam :) A lot of gay bars all down the street, but not sure if that was because of Pride some time before :P I loved the place, and will definately come back there again :D
2013-04-09, COLD... SO COLD.... FREEZING!!!!
2013-05-01, The hostel wasn't clean, WC were dirty and smelly, beds aren´t good but the location was really good.
2013-03-28, There wasnt heating in the hostel, so sleeping was hard. kitchen facilities were poor rather there wasnt any kitchen in the family accomodation part of the hostel.
2013-04-16, Loved this hostel. Would stay again no problem. We stayed in a private double room with private en suite. Very clean, staff were friendly and helpful. Only problem was that ours was on the very top floor and the stairs are small and very windy! But it wasn't too bad. There is also a gorge common room with a little balcony. Don't leave stuff in the fridge though cause people will take it! Thanks again :) Cat.
2013-03-16, A very plain hostel, cheap and close to the city. You get what you pay for so its a fair deal. Luxury seekers definitely shouldnt go there. Who just needs a convenient place to stay will be fine.
2013-03-27, the true problem of this hostel is the space because there too many beds in small rooms and the bathroom is a bit ridicolous, the best thing is the location
2013-03-28, Excellent location, and if you literally just need a bed and internet then this is your place. But it has no common areas and if you stay in the mixed room downstairs the WC and showers are in front of receiption with no doors so is very weird and uncomfortable. Staff was very nice to me and location couldn't be bettter.
2013-03-11, We stayed at the attic at the 6th floor, it was huge! My husband loved it but I hated climbing up and down 6 storeys...love it that they had a kettle to boil water..lighting was pretty dim..I think those that came with bigger groups of friends would love the attic, there were two sofas in the room..heater wasn't really strong and we felt cold most of the time..it's pretty good considering the amt we paid
2012-07-31, For this price to stay in excellent location, i have no complain!! \r \r I definite like the rooms contains :\r 1. every bed is a single desk bed \r 2. we have a lot of comman space\r 3. Boconly\r 4. Boiling water machine\r 5. Mircowaves\r 3.
2013-05-14, Aivengo Hostel is in a great location, close to the train station and within walking distance of all major sites. The staff when we arrived was very helpful and friendly providing us with a map and showing us where to go! We stayed in a 20 bed dorm which had uncomfortable beds and was really loud and the door to the dorm room didn't always lock. The bathrooms were small and not very clean with no toilet seats. Hostel was a fine place to stay for 14€ but we probably wouldn't return.
2013-03-14, Staff were friendly/helpful. Location was good. 4 bed private room was large with high ceilings so was very cold- weather was freezing outside. There were only thin wierd smelling blankets and pillows provided with hair on them! We were too scared to leave anything valuable there as the locker was broken and the front door had clearly previously been broken into- lots of paint and wood chipped under a new lock. The mattress' were broken, lumpy and uncomfortable and bunkbeds were broken.
2013-03-09, This is quite simply the least inviting place I have ever stayed in, including three of Amsterdam's other budget hostels. That is to say I had low expectations but was still let down.\r \r Nowhere to relax (two 2-seat couches for 40 guests?), shocking security arrangements, lights too bright in the room, cramped and all-too-visible washing and toilet facilities, hot water only available from the shower.\r \r The staff's local knowledge was non-existent too., though they were friendly enough.
2013-02-28, Great location, friendly staff, clean, handy lockers in bedroom, good value for money.
2013-02-24, Kitchen should be bigger
2013-03-06, Amazing big double room not very expencive, 5 minutes fron the train station and from downtown, really nice and comfortable. The only thing is that you get to excercise a bit, as it is(at least our private double room) at the 6th floor without elevator :) Definetely reccomended
2013-02-08, After a first night which was very cold (the heater didn't work), we complained and the gave us an electrical heater. The second night was much nicer !
2013-03-08, The hostel is overpriced for the quality of the facilities, the kitchen consist in a microwave, a couple of cups, kettle, and a table and it is located right in the bathroom. Besides the beds are in bad condition even the mattresses. But on the other hand is very well located right in the city center, near from the train station and supermarkets.
2013-01-25, Super friendly staff, very helpful. Perfect location, only a 5 min walk from Central Station and then only 5 mins from hostel to Dam Square.
2013-01-22, I spent a great time in aviengo hostel. Thanks for you welcome, I'm going to work my english :) and, I return see you soon ..
2013-01-10, if you're looking for a cheap bed for a few nights, this is it.
2013-02-15, We had our own sleeping bags and it was great idea because in the hostel there are only thin blankets and it moght be cold during winter nights (it's definitely not a problem but should be mentioned somewhere for people who are always cold). During weekend I think noone cleaned our bathroom and it wasn't in a perfect shape, there was no toilet paper.\r But the location is soi great that any other things are not so importatn.. ;)
2012-11-30, Kitchen could not be used.
2013-02-03, We had a comfortable 2nights stay with hostel aivengo. We bookedthe 2 single beds in the attic. The room was clean & the same with the shower. The only thing i could suggest is maybe a curtain for those bright mornings, brighter lights for the bedroom &bathroom.; At the time only lamp worked in bed area. Must mention the stairs will be difficult for unfit ppl. We really appreciated the help the guy at the front desk gave us, he walked us to our train! thankyou so much it meant alot =)
2012-11-16, Totally recommend this hostel. Very central and located on a quiet street. Staff very helpful. Had a room on the fourth floor which was really spacious and warm. There was also a kitchenette which was handy. The bathroom was clean and the shower was powerful and hot. Good lockers and luggage storage facilities - all included. I would definitely stay here again.
2013-03-06, If your looking for the basic package its ok nothing special you get a bed and a locker but the location of the toilets left a lot to be desired, right next to the kitchen area ( a ledge a few plates and a kettle) but then again it's Amsterdam so I suppose u don't have to use it.
2012-11-13, The room is roomy and pleasant. The location is excellent, however should improving the reception and appearance of the stairs and lobby.
2012-11-12, It is only a pity. that the heating system was out of order. The rest was great and really thank you for giving us that room as we felt as we were the owner.
2012-12-14, What´s important to know about this hostel and unfortunately not on the website: BRING A SLEEPING BAG!! There are sheets on the mattress but none for the blanket, and those are not being washed after using. \r The location is perfect and the staff is very nice and helpful. However, there are only 2 rooms with 20 beds each and 1 bathroom area, no common room or kitchen where you could hang out or eat something. If you´re just there for going out and sleep, that´s totally fine.
2012-11-04, At night it was very very cold.I had to sleep with my clothes and a jacket on.\r However located in a great location, WiFi working great all the time and the stuff was mire than helpful.
2012-11-01, The pictures from the site are not the real deal. The hostel is not that pretty.\r The common area is too small to hang out and they do not organize any tours or activities so it is hard to meet people. If you go alone, you will probable stay alone. People only hang out in the rooms.\r The location is perfect, though. And they are clean enough.
2012-10-24, Location is great the staff are ok.\r I would recommend it but not highly.
2012-11-05, Its a sleeping hostel, its not expensive, but its not much, all though i can say the wifi works in the room downstairs, theres no common room. Ad no kitchen, no table to read in room an only 1 plug. Lucky for the people who were staying there at that moment. There was a English girl, with a plug multiplyer. The matras is nothing and in winter time in Holland i really advise to bring a sleepingbag because the blanket provided is thinner as u skin.
2012-07-20, well located (5 min away from Centraal Station).Good enough if you just need a bed in a dorm for a very short stay.
2012-10-24, - Not really a kitchen, just some stuff in the corner of the bathroom. Bathroom is a open area direct next to the reception desk, with tiny facilities. \r - noisy and shaky bunk beds, no real pillows and blankets, therefore too cold to sleep comfortably \r - no common room\r \r Overall no comfort for few money. \r \r But free internet and nice location, next to train station and shopping streets.
2012-10-21, A great hostel to stay in :) staff were extremely helpful!!
2012-10-23, The location is really good, very close to the train station, and it's on the big road, so very convenient.\r But it's too noisy at night. You can hear people speak loudly on the road and the street noise at midnight.\r It have the heatings in the room but they just give you a thin blanket, it's a little cold at night.\r No breakfast.
2012-10-22, The rooms were very nice and I thought that everything was kept pretty clean. The only complaint I would have is that the beds were really creaky and loud and we ran out of toilet paper and there wasn't any extra stored in the room. But it wasn't a big deal. I felt safe the whole time and felt that my belongings were safe too. I really appreciated the free internet! Overall, I think it was a great experience.
2012-10-20, Only a 10-15 min walk from the train station. 15 min walk to the red light, close to all your restaurants and night life, I was here during ADE so plenty going on and wasnt far from many of the clubs. A great place to store my stuff and crash although my particular bed was a shocker, made a noise to any movement.
2012-10-08, its beautiful room with a good view we have, and a little balcony with windows, unfortunately there's no kitchen. probably because thats a very old building, so they're afraid of getting fire. we got a private double bed ensuite, so its more like a hotel room than a hostel. its great, the room is very huge!! but the problem is, its on 6th floor and there's no elevator, its trully an exercise. but it doesnt matter for us. we are very happy of stayed there.
2012-10-19, Terrible. Each morning the guy working at the hostel would walk in, turn the lights on an hour before check out, and play techno music loudly from the reception, which is right next to the dorms. The bed consisted of a thin foam mattress, which meant you didn't sleep at all properly. The blankets provided where thin, and no where near warm enough for end of October. There are only two plugs in the dorm for 20 people, meaning you won't get a chance to charge phones/ipods.
2012-10-07, Hostel was good for its price, I was in a 20 room dorm with a couple friends. The beds are clean and comfortable, good toilets and showers. Only thing that needed work was the kitchen that was small and pretty much in the toilet area. Only a microwave and small fridge for 30+ people to use. The communal area was small and in front of the reception so it was hard to socialise outside of your rooms.\r \r All in all it was good for its worth and got what you needed the most. I would go again.
2012-09-27, Nice little hostel with rooms in different buildings...
2012-10-04, We booked this hostel because it was one of the only hostels with vacancy. It was fairly cheap, and cheap is what we got. The beds were barren, and somewhat dirty. Fortunately I had a sleeping bag with me as the sheet provided wouldn't have been of any use. The staff was not very helpful, and even when advised of basic issues (e.g. no toilet paper in the bathroom) the issues remained unfixed.\r If you are on a tight budget, this place is cheap. But the price is about all you get.
2012-09-26, Really, really liked it.
2012-09-29, stayed in the 6th Floor 2 single bed private room where we had access to a living space, kitchen, and rooftop balcony. Is this really a hostel?\r \r The staff were very cool and miss victoria explained everything very clearly. They even provided a map of the city which would cost you around 3 euros from tourist information.
2012-09-26, Everything was fine, wouldn't hesitate to come back. Close to the Centraal train station and downtown.
2012-09-06, Great staff and hostel!
2012-09-16, Staff was great! One man with bit longer hair was nice all the time! He help us with everything! Great really!!!
2012-09-18, Great friendly hostel.\r \r Only small detail: the blankets are too thin, duvets might be better (especially in the autumn)!
2012-08-24, The only think I find annoying were staires cause with luggage to drag it up and down was quite difficult. But the female dorm was nice, clean enaugh. Be aware that it's better to bring you own balnket since they give you just plaid without any blanket. Although 1 bathroom for 10-12 girls is rather too bad I didn't experience many problems with it since all girls had different time schedule.
2011-10-18, There was a mouse in the room that ate the food who were in bags that guests left the ground at night. And every day we had to wake up at 9 o'clock, because the woman cleaner opened the room, opened the windows and began to clean up even when you're sleeping. A great lack of respect!
2012-08-24, We booked a room for 4 people in a private dorm. We were pleased to notice the cleanliness and the size of the room.\r The only problem in this room is that Amsterdam is quite cold the whole year and the blanket provided were really thin and old. We would have hoped to get some real bed sheets with real blankets. It was hard on all of us.
2012-08-11, The people who work there make that place amazing!\r also the art of the hostel is amazing.
2012-08-22, This hostel was cheap and no fuss. The staff were friendly and the location of the hostel is excellent, only five minutes walk from Centraal Train Station. I wouldn't stay here if you are staying in Amsterdam for more than four days - there are very few powerpoints and the rooms are huge with loads of beds, so not much privacy. But there are a couple of computers with free internet, and you're only a few minutes walk from everything.
2012-08-09, The hostel is well located but the staff is not friendly (there is an exception). The room is disorganized and they don't have pillows, they offer something like a small pad to sleep. They don't have a kitchen but just a microwave but they don't offer plates or cutlery. It means you can't prepare anything to eat there. There is no a table to eat or to use your own computer as well.
2012-08-05, Very minimal and small but cheap and in a good location.
2012-08-05, Excellent location in central Amsterdam. Too many stairs and noisy guests, but if you just want to sleep there it's very good!
2012-11-14, Not really a great place to stay to be honest, I felt like staying in on of those places that gives charity to homeless people. The room is just horrible, you can hear everything from the outside, even the steps from people walking on the sidewalk, no heat at all, the blanket was so thing that I had to sleep with my sweater because it gets so cold at night and also they don't even bother on changing the bed sheets, and they open leave the door open in the morning,even if you are still sleeping.
2012-07-17, My dorm was in the adjacent building, on the fourth floor with no elevator. But the room was airy and bright, with an ensuite bathroom and a kitchenette (fridge and sink, no stove). Each guest gets a locker for free (10 euro deposit).
2012-06-28, The dorm for women seemed A LOT nicer than the onw for men
2012-06-30, This hostel was very clean and the location was perfect - really close to everything. We enjoyed our stay here. Definitely not a party type hostel which isn't necessarily a bad thing it just depends what you are after.
2012-07-24, This place is in a great location, the showers are small but pump out hot water, wifi is strong, the staff are helpful and the place is nicely decorated. Most guests found it strange to have the reception right there next to the toilets showers and wash basins. I didnt mind too much especially when your towel drops while your brushing your teeth and 4 danish girls are checking in next to you. They need thicker beds,pillows and checkout should be 11am. These simple things might improve ya rating!
2012-06-24, the hostel was OK, but way too expensive for the facilities provided.the hostel was cold, dirty and the code for the door could have been broken by a monkey. Iv been to Amsterdam many times and all the budget accommadation in the city center is bad and very pricey, I ask why?
2012-06-04, It was great but kitchen should be little big n separate from \r washroom area. I give 8/10
2012-06-18, I had a great stay at Aivengo. Really nice staff and the all-female dorm was great. The mixed dorms on the ground floor looked really hectic, so I wouldn't stay there if I were travelling with a mixed group, but I would definitely stay there again in the female dorm.
2012-06-03, You pay for what you get, It was a cheap option that I was pretty happy with really. Would stay here again.
2012-06-14, Handy and a bit more quiet location nevertheless in the center. We stayed in a big dorm located in a building next door, a large, nice, and light room with its own kitchen and bathroom and semi-balcony. The only thing that was not so satisfying were the iron beds keeping a lot of noise, can they be lubricated or something? ;) Otherwise totally recommended!
2012-06-10, it is not possible to get a nights sleep here as lights are always on in the dorm room nd no one will keep theire voice down even late at night. so if you come to party and need a place to crash this may be it.\r if you come to do stuff during the day this is not recommended. also the bed I slept in was very poor, I´ve slept on benches that was better.
2012-05-08, the toilet is too small, only blanket for cover is not enough, better to have plug in the room
2012-06-02, The hostel was clean and well-managed and the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. They offered suggestions on where to go, including how to stay safe because we were two females travelling alone. Any concerns we had were dealt with quickly and efficiently. A bag was left behind on our last day and the staff went out of their way to have it returned. I had a fantastic stay and would definitely go back to Aivengo if I am ever in Amsterdam again. I recommend staying here!!
2012-05-04, We had a fabulous time at the Aivengo. We were travelling in a group of 9 and felt like we had our own private flat. The staff were nice and helpful and the location was excellent. The only downfall we had was that the hot water ran out after around the 6th persons shower, make sure you get in first! We had a fun filled weekend!
2014-04-06, Wonderful location (practically in the center). Safe area. Would stay again. Only warning is be ready to be fighting to keep your phone with battery since there are only four electrical outlets for 20 people.
2012-03-24, I agree with everyone that the blanket was too thin. I slept under my jacket as well to keep warm. Otherwise an acceptable centrally located hostel at a good price. I thought the security on the female dorms was good, and the staff were friendly. I wish the sinks and the shower were not in the same room, because brushing your teeth in the morning could take a while. The internet was free, which was great, but tended to be unreliable, particularly during peak periods. I'd stay again. Good price.
2012-05-25, We booked for 3 people in a 10 person room. The room was overbooked, so we were always 11-12 people, and there was ONLY ONE bathroom for all of us (which also contained the shower, so for one you waited forever) . To top it off the bathroom made the room noisy constantly.\r \r The last night I had a matress instead of a bed, so I was provided with a 'matress' that was maybe 5 cm thick, and a pillow that was smaller than my wallet. It would have been the same if I slept on the floor.
2012-03-18, The hostel is quite easy to find n is a convient location as it is near the Amsterdam central station. Besides the hostel doesn't have elevator n I have to go to 5/F every day, everything is pretty good.
2012-03-09, wow! For a hostel a this price I have to admit I was scared and sceptical! People who are used to sleepe in hostel will understand ;)! very good stay, we were able to let our luggage at the reception the last day. Everything if very well furnished and very clean and guess what!: quiet by night in the middle Amsterdam! The people sleeping here are here to sleep and not continuing their night! highly recommended!
2012-02-27, Bring your own sheets. The female only dorm is good. The mixed dorm not that attractive...
2012-04-21, We stayed in the female room on the 4th floor. The room and the facilities were pretty much OK except for several things.\r If you need wifi you better stay on the first or second floor, because the signal doesn't reach the upper floors. Be aware that there are mice on the premises - a lot of them :) They come out only in the night and if you leave any food outside the kitchen cabinets, fridge or inside your bag you'll not be able to sleep. Do not leave your bags open in the night! :)
2012-02-22, Uncomfortable bed in a cold room with only a very thin blanket. Don't expect a good nights sleep here. Free WiFi is good though, as is the location.
2012-02-16, The staff was helpful, the girl's dorm was clean, the bed was a bit squeaky and the blanket a bit too thin. The location is good. Good value for the price.
2012-03-08, No bed sheet and a too light blanket. The first night the heater was broken. Terrible smell of vomit for 3 days. The place was almost clean but the smell was unacceptable. No common areas. The 'kitchen' is in the bathroom and the bathroom is in the atrium divided by a curtain. The position of the hostel is excellent however it offers a really poor service. It compleatly miss the hostel atmosphere: a place to meet people.
2012-02-10, too Cold, very bad condition. need some renewal. investing some € is a must!\r Stuff was Okay, location is close to the main station.
2012-02-10, Cute inexpensive hostel within 5min walking distance of Amsterdam central station. Very charming. The dorm we stayed in was equipped with fridges, a microwave and an electric kettle - very practical! Only the beds were slightly uncomfortable, but we were so tired at the end of the day that we slept anyway. ^^
2012-01-05, The place was not well illuminated, and the beds were not comfortable. IT DID NOT HAVE SOCKETS TO CHARGE THE BATTERIES OF COMPUTERS AND CAMERAS...WE ARE TRAVELING, SO WE NEED ELECTRICITY FOR OUR EQUIPMENTS!!! The rooms were not well warmed, and there are not places to eat.
2011-12-08, should be more selfserved dishes or cooking instuments
2011-12-02, It was nice and pleasant stay. Good considering the budget.
2011-12-27, Everything was very good except for the beds which were noisy and unconfortable\r I will sure recommend this place
2011-12-01, Good Hostel, great location. It is negative that this hostel has no space for kitchen and living room. And it was really annoying that they were opening the door every morning at 9 o clock and the cold was passing inside the room. They must respect their clients
2011-11-28, Great location! Everything you would expect for the price.
2011-11-25, Nasty place but in a very good location...DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE!
2011-11-20, The location is amazing, and I felt very safe in the neighborhood by myself even at night. I stayed in the female dorm which I would definitely recommend to other females. Its a cool loft setup with our own bathroom and kitchen. The mixed rooms were right off reception along with the bathrooms and seemed like they lacked any privacy. There was also no common room so its difficult to meet people outside of your dorm. Ultimately though I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again!
2011-11-19, the room was great, the lobby was a bit smelly. overall very recommendable!
2011-11-16, rooms are very nice with lock provided. there is no elevator, so that it had been quite difficult to take the luggage upstairs...
2011-12-01, Shared rooms: people who think that beds are for sleeping, BEWARE! My roommates decided that since outside was cold, drinking alcohol in public places is prohibited and the pubs are expensive, they had the same right to start party in the bedroom after midnight as other people had to try to sleep in their beds. So don´t you think that you will find a quiet place just because it is not in the pub area.
2011-11-04, No complaints at all.\r Would I stay again? Yes.\r Would I recomment to friends? Yes
2011-11-01, Extremely helpful and friendly staff :) Thank you!
2011-10-22, Amazing location... super clean, open loft dorms. Beds aren't the most comfortable, but all the same its a great hostel.
2012-03-22, This was a big let down from the description...needs some love...twin room was a mess....not clean enough....foul smell from the sink in the en suite...squeaky beds...the blind door to the toilet was broken an pointless even being there...bed covers are far too thin so we were cold at night apart from all that the location was good but just somewhere to sleep really.
2013-09-01, staff is very friendly ..and the location is perfect
2011-11-12, Loved the staff esp. the Czech republic guy so really friendly, takes initiative carried my suitcase and just such a pleasant smile. I stayed in the 13 bed female dorms with ensuite bathroom/ kitchen on 4th floor. I agree with another guest, mattresses are so tiny you can feel every bar of the bed. Blankets and pillows are thin what a joke. Although some ppl may say this was a bad thing, for me it was great as I love happy places but 6 girls couldn't stop laughing for hours and hours, you wonder
2011-09-23, Very small towel in the private room! Ask to the guests to take one with them. Exept for this great room almost at the roof top and great location.\r I hope to join you again.
2011-10-12, I stated in the 10 bed all girls dorm. It was cute and clean with its own bath, kitchen, fridge, lockers you must rent. You get a sheet and a hand towel free. There ARE mice. One girl saw one and I had a bag of food chewed through. Free wireless on the ground floor and a computer. NO common area.
2011-10-15, The staff, particularly the Czech guy, are very helpful and friendly. The location is great for getting to and fro the train station and exploring the Red Light District. In virtually any direction from the hostel there is something to do or see. The 20 bed dorm does the job ok, and its not the Hostels fault you get people at all hours making noise and switching all the lights on. The showers and toilets are opposite and in full view of the reception, which sucks a bit.
2011-09-16, Cannot rate this place enough. I was there in Sept 2011 and stayed on the 4th floor. Lockers for each person. Staff were very helpful when I had friends arriving on different days, they made sure we were all in the same room. Place was clean and location ideal - close to Centraal station and close to Dam Square! Will definitely go back!
2011-09-14, I get what I expected. But be careful if you have dust-allergies: the blankets are quite dusty.
2011-09-12, A very nice place. For being so small, it was still well maintained and the staff was very friendly.
2011-08-27, Excelent! It's an amazing hostel, I'd tell anyone to go there! The staff were lovely, let us borrow their umbrellas. There was a little concussion with payment that was quickly resolved.
2006-04-25, It needs to be stated that a cat is always present in the hotel common room because I am highly allergic. It created a poor experience.
2012-01-03, I had 2 mice under my bed and after having noticed them at night I went to the reception in the next morning. The staff said it's "normal" in Amsterdam and that they'd have traps and would put more in our room. They did NOTHING! So the next night we prepared the mice's "house" on ourself with some magazines and a chair and could sleep (like maybe the mice did?!). Maybe mice are the price we paid for having a bed in an Amsterdam hostel for 11,-€/night...?!
2011-08-16, A hostel better suited for younger travellers and party-ers. So many people in one room makes it a bit noisy for sleeping. But in a central location.
2011-08-14, The mattresses urgently need to change. They are so thin that the main bar in the bed-frame stuck into my back. If you need a flat bed, this is not the place.
2011-09-15, Nice hostel to know more abt the building in Netherlands... It's in a traditional building... Narrow building...:) If the floor can b much clean( some dirty left near my bed ) n with Wifi in rooms upstairs.. It will b perfect!
2011-07-22, Disclaimer: My girlfriend and I had our own room with a private bath. These accommodations are not even in the same building as the regular hostel. Hence, my review does not speak to what most people will experience there.
2011-08-14, Doesn't have a common area so if you want to meet people you´ll have to do it outside or in the 22 mixed room (as i did)!\r I changed to a 10 female room the last night and it was perfect, really big place, clean and with many facilities!
2011-07-19, Just good for a bed and thats it.
2011-07-13, no kitchen, no extra room
2011-09-16, Most annoying thing were the hostel staff opening the door and switching on the lights at 9am, starting to make the beds, plus talking fairly loudly (not too sure if that was mainly guests to be honest). Didn't have high expectations as I read the previous reviews, but was still rather disappointed with how small and unfriendly everything seemed. Cheapest hostel I could find over the weekend though, there was a bed (not a comfy one), alright bathrooms and internet, so it's all I needed.
2011-07-06, Good location near central station and dam square, cheap by Amsterdam standards! helpful staff and very clean, would stay again.
2011-07-09, I thought the hostel was in an excellent location and was clean, tidy and good value for money. The staff were very friendly and spoke perfect English. The wifi didn't work very well though and it was shame that there was no communal area.
2011-08-03, the shower smelled. there were mice in some other rooms, the 'kitchen' is a fridge with a microwave on top of it, there were NO outlets except at the front desk, and it was overcrowded.
2011-07-20, 3 days with 6 girlfriends. A 4 bedroom ensuite and a 2 bedroom ensuite. Upon arrival we were told that the 2 rooms were each in a different building in a different street. The 2 bedroom ensuite was nice:it had bedding + good matresses. 4 bedroom ensuite:2 bunkbeds. I travelled over the world in the cheapest places and I have never seen matresses like that before. The matresses: completely worn out. Al I saw and felt were the springs. Even sleeping on the bare floor would be nicer.
2011-06-21, Had free wifi and computer available. Only three working showers while we were there for the whole hostel. There were mice in the room. Not much of a common area. Located walking distance from the train station.
2011-06-24, Myslef and 3 friends stayed at Aivengo 24th-26th June 2011. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful in helping us find our way around the area. The hostel was nice, clean and tidy. \r Would definitey recommend if you were going for a fun weekend in Amsterdam and want to be close to all the best palces around town.\r \r Thank you Aivengo! :)
2011-06-24, This hostel was good although cooking facilities were lacking. if you are looking for somewhere to crash for a couple of nights this place is cool although expect to be woken up regulary if you stay in the 20 person dorm! Good overall!
2013-06-27, It was a good value for the money. The staff were nice, but not exceptionally friendly. The internet was good, I wish there had been more outlets, though.
2011-06-19, Staff were helpful and they have computers with internet that are free to use. Located close to the main train station. Only drawback is that the doors are locked for 2 hours every night (4-6 AM) but that wasn't a problem for us.
2011-06-26, I stayed for two nights in this hostel. THE hostel has a great location and excellent staff. Staff is helpful and can speak english very well. One thing that i did not like is that there was quite a lot of noise at night from vehicle passing by the road and also improvement is needed in beds as they were not very comfortable. overall a very good hostel at a budget price and location wise.
2011-05-24, Nice hostel and really friendly!!! But Inside the rooms doesn't have plug/ switches to charge mobile, camera or other things.\r So hard... Because all the time we need to ask the receptionist and then to leave there all the stuff charging.
2011-04-19, It's the best you can get considering the location, helpfull and patient staff. \r free internet ! wifi ! that one was of the hook !
2011-05-11, When we reached the hostel, we are being told to go to another street where our room is located.and its located on a small street which we think its not safe, however, luckily nothing dangerous happen during our stay. our room is very clean. however, the mattress are very old and we slept till our back is very painful.
2011-04-07, I fount the hostel very dirty! I was actually shocked with the state of the bed I was given. It was a bunk bed and the top bed had a terrible smell. I didnºt even use their bedding cos i found it in a very bad condition. My bed sheet had a massive hole in it and not a single person cared for it. i will never go back there again! Plus the rip off for such a dirty place.
2011-04-07, The hostel was in a great location, but lacked a general common room, which made sleeping and meeting people very unpleasant. The matresses were paper thin onto metal grid beds - very uncomfortable. The lack of kitchen facilities does not contribute to a budget holiday. There are several floors, which is unlucky if you're on the bottom floor because you can hear people stomp around upstairs. The noise from the street is also very loud.
2011-03-19, the toilet smells even after cleaning..room with 20 beds actually has 22..has free towels, lockers, centred..would recommend good price, and actually nice bed is all we needed after a long day in amsterdam.
2011-03-15, Wonderful hostel!City center! very safe place! rooms beautifully decorated, warm atmosphere!! Very helpfull staff! Big recommend!!!Thank You and see You again guys!!!!
2011-03-22, I love the location, walking distance to the main central station, and they have a super market very close by.\r We had the private room, and the bathroom had a jacuzzy, which I didn't have time to use. It had a little kitchen with small refrigerator, but no microwave, nor utensils to cook. The only bad thing is that the room is on the 6th floor, and no elevator, other than pretty good for the price we pay. Very friendly stuff, they offered to help with the luggage.
2011-05-02, I would stay here again, primarily because of the location and the price. Both were excellent. Plus they have free internet which is useful. Downsides are that the bed was pretty uncomfortable and there was only one bathroom in the dorm between 10 girls - ok if you get up earlier than everyone else, but if not you'll have to wait around or go outside and back into the main building where there's more showers. There also isn't a communal area to hang out so that reduces the social aspect a bit.
2011-03-12, The hostel is in front Red Light, but is closer to the central station. \r The clenear enter in your room before the check out and i was in the bathroom, i didn't like this situation!
2011-06-10, this was my first time to Europe and to a hostel. I've visited several countries now and so far Aivengo has been a GREAT hostel. i recommend it to every one. The location is the best, as soon as you walk out you already have everything Amsterdam has to offer; bars, restaurants, coffee-shops, red-light, mini-markets, magic shops, metro station. i was amazed of all the things that are available from the door step of this hostel.\r now the staff, this guys are really cool, very helpful and very nice.
2011-03-10, I found the staff really helpful - especially the guy who checked me in and who shared my thoughts on how awful birthdays are! The location is great and there was a really nice feel to this place - obviously I was also lucky with the people in my dorm. The dorm was really big, lots of space and not very noisy. I would stay here again! Thank you :)
2011-02-28, Towels are not free as it is mentioned in their web site. It cost 1€.
2011-03-04, A nice cheap hostel. Was a bit hesitant about staying in a 20 bed dorm but was good. Showers were great. Only complaint I have is that they left the door to the dorm open from 9am letting noise from reception in and making it hard to sleep in. So bring your earplugs/eyemask. Also note the lock out 4-6am. They only provide 1 blanket, so I brought 1 of my own, but to be honest the heating is turned up enough that it was sufficient for me. I did hear a guy next to the window complain though.
2011-02-22, Bring something warm to sleep in. :) The staff at the desk were sooo helpful and welcoming. Thank you!
2011-02-16, This hostel was close to Centraal Station, downtown Amsterdam, and the staff was really nice. You do get what you pay for and there seemed to be no heat in the hostel when I visited in February. No biggie considering what I saved in money. The only suggestions I would make is to remove the non-functioning door (serves as a window now?) they have in the mixed dorm room because it lets the cold in and you can hear everybody's conversation smoking outside through that door.
2011-02-23, You get what you pay for! The 4 person room was very very basic and the bunk beds were like sleeping on rocks, but after being on the lash all day its somewhere to crash. The shower was really good and the location was 5 mins from everywhere, i think the receptionist was a bit hangover on our arrival but a pleasant guy. Would recommend if your a group of mates after a bed with a roof over your head and thats it, which close to the station and main bars etc
2011-01-03, The dorms were nice and clean. The only problem was that there was only one shower for 10 girls to share. So there was a lot of waiting... The location was excellent! I'd definitely stay there again.
2014-06-24, Only 2 plug points
2010-12-21, we enjoyed our stay a lot!! it was a really nice place. i recommend this to all first timers and experienced travelers.
2011-03-03, I think the best thing about this hostel is the location. They had warm water. Nothing else! We stayed in a twin room with a bathroom. It was the smallest and most uncomfortable room I’ve ever stayed. Moreover, you can’t use half of the room as the ceiling gets lower and lower. It was in the sixth floor and they didn’t offer any help although I had asked for it. The room was not that clean. The bathroom looked so so, but I had to clean someone else’s hairs in the tiny shower cabin.Bathroom had a folding door which was broken. In other words there was no door in the bathroom. We complained about it; they told they would fix it, but they simply ignored it. The beds were terrible. We woke up each time we turned around and it was not possible not to turn as you feel the bedsprings in your back. There were no extra blankets and we slept with our coats and hats. The staff needs social training. Most probably he felt how disappointed we were but instead of trying to compensate, he avoided eye contact. When I complained about the hairs in the bathroom, they only looked at each other and didn’t say one single word to us. If we had had more time in Amsterdam, we would have definitely tried to find somewhere else. I would never ever recommend Aivengo Hostel to any of my friends. Horrid!
2010-12-28, Good in general. But some facility is not sufficient, such as socket and pantry. Even not a single socket in the room that 20 people stay.
2014-06-05, Perfectly adequate! Would stay here again. My friend and I were in the 10 bed female dorm and we had a great stay. Everyone else in the full room was very respectful and quiet. This isn't a party hostel, it's a place to sleep. I felt that everything was clean and the beds were surprisingly comfortable. I also liked that the female dorm is 10 separate beds, not bunk beds. The room is very large and felt airy. It even has a nice little balcony too! As a heads up, there is a red light corner nearby
2014-05-29, Great experience at Aviengo Hostel. The staff was very kind and helpful throughout my stay. The hostel is in a great location, and the beds were very comfortable. Overall, a great stay that satisfied all my needs.
2014-05-01, We had a private room. It was clean and safe, which is all we really asked for. Staff were helpful if we had a query. Would stay again.
2014-06-09, no air con but its in a great location the size of bathroom and shower room was a joke but its decent no one wanted to talk to each other and there was no way meeting new people
2014-06-05, 5 of us from the US stayed at this hostel and loved it. We chose the women's mixed dorm and it definitely was the way to go. The room was a huge loft with a giant window over looking Spuitstraat St. The location is perfect in the center of the city. 10/15 minute walk to Anne Frank/ Dam Square & many other attractions. This hostel is also super close to Grand Central Station which is great for travelers .The front desk tenant was so helpful & sweet, and we had free wifi. Room was cleaned daily.
2014-05-27, Ok. The room is really closed, no sun coming in. Nice location, and for the money, it worths!
2014-05-13, 22 beds in a dorm... Cheap, gets the job done. Staff was friendly, shitters are tiny, but I'm also a large American.
2014-05-15, Actually there is nothing special thing except the location. It takes only 5 mintes from central station. Staff at front desk exactly do what he had to do neither kind or rude. I stayed in 20mix dorm and it smelled bad but can be bearable.
2014-05-13, I stayed with my friend in the 10 female dorm and it was spacious. There is a bathroom, a kitchen with microwave and fridge in the dorm. Wifi is strong in the room. The location of the hostel is excellent and it is just five minutes away from the station and easy to locate.
2014-05-01, Average for a hostel but price is far too high for what you get
2014-04-26, Great location, good staff. Atmosphere was slightly lacking with little to no common area, but taking a few steps out into the city fixed that.
2014-04-25, The staff are unfriendly and rushed me out before the check out time
2014-05-02, From all the hostels I have stayed, this is the worst. Price is abaurdly high (I paid 45 euros per night) and quality is way too poor. Cleanliness is too poor, bed sheets look like they have been around for 20 years and they wash them every 2 months. There is just 2 rooms of 20 people and 4 toilets and 4 showers for all of them. I have to say that is well located and staff try to be helpful.
2014-04-21, The location of this hostel is spot on! It is very near to Amsterdam Centraal and places of attraction is within walking distance which is very, very convenient. The staffs are very helpful and friendly.
2014-04-17, Hostel has everything you need but it's quite expensive. The location is great as it's a 5 min walk from Centraal Station and you can walk to some main attractions. Hostel lacks a friendly, warm atmosphere.
2014-04-13, The staff was really good and helpfull, cosy place! If i go back to amsterdam i will deffenitly live there again!
2014-04-12, They should communicate the hosts that they would be separated in two different rooms and if there is no possibility to change, do everything that's possible to help. \r They were really unpolite.
2014-05-20, The hostel is not bad.It's a VERY low-cost hostel which is good for people who don't really care to have a nice stay but just a place to sleep.\r Our room was next to the entrance and there was no real window or something.Because of that,the whole room was smelling.The toilets are next to the entrance and the "reception" and you can see everything which is pretty uncomfortable.Fortunately enough,toilets and rooms were not dirty.\r At this point,I would like to comment that the staff was horrible.
2014-04-11, Very good location only. Dirty facilities, bad atmosphere, no kitchen facilities.
2014-04-15, The only thing I liked from Aivengo Hostel was that the bathrooms were clean and the staff members were nice to us. But, the Hostel's reception/ living room is too small and uncomfortable. Although I was staying in a 22-beds room, I think they can be rearrange, somehow, in a more organized way, so it would give a more private appearance.\r In addition, there is only ONE plug for the 22 beds, so it was impossible for me to charge my cel phone and my camera. OveralI, I don't recomend the hostel.
2014-04-11, Five of us stayed in the female 10 bed dorm. A key was required to get into the room and the main door. We also had lockers so we always felt secure. Staff were friendly and helpful. We didn't hang out in the hostel much as we preferred to do our own thing so this place was ideal for what we needed. We would stay here again.
2014-04-07, Great place. Warm and cosy with sparks of vintage style. However there is only one plug for each dorm of 20 people which is not convenient and the lockers are quite small.\r Apart from them very nice conditions and clean to stay, easy access to many fun places in Ams.
2012-11-08, hey everyone!\r it wasnt a bad stay - and with a room that holds 20 people, it often depends on the individuals, however there wasnt a real feel of cleanliness. i was in an upper bunk-bed - a thin matrices held up by thin metal beams and on thick pole through the centre pressing through the bed and into my back - which wasnt particularly comfortable and the locker felt like it had been forcefully opened before... \r it wasnt a bad stay and served its purpose, and the price was fine...
2014-04-03, Really colorfull place, the 20 people room only has a small window, so there is a lack of air circulation. Despite that, beds are really comfortable and the staff is really nice. There is no kitchen! Just a spot with a microwave.
2014-03-31, I would still chose this hostel next time!
2014-04-03, The room smelt so bad. There were no kitchens, the mugs were too dirty to use. The bed sheets seemed very worrying. Hostel staff barely spoke to us. They didn't give any guidance as in where to go and just seemed indifferent. People didn't talk to others in the same room. It was kinda depressing to live in. \r I know for the price probably we couldn't ask more, but maybe just some better sheets and a smile will make a difference.
2014-03-31, The location is great and it's a good place to stay if you don't need to cook and if you don't mind not having a comunal area.
2014-03-31, Really nice room, with a lot of space and private bathroom per room. It is located in a nice street, easy to find and near the train station. The staff was kind, friendly and helpfull. Really enjoyed my stay there, one of the best hostels I've ever been.
2006-04-12, Very nice staff, useful tipps for sightseeing stuff. Cosy atmosphere, especially for peeps who like cats - Andar, we will miss u!
2014-03-22, My room was supposed to be a 10-bed room but there were 13 beds there on the first night I stayed. The building is quite old and there's no stove to use. But everything was quite clean and the location is perfect. Would recommend.
2014-03-05, They did what they could with the space. it is located in charming golden age building with small communal space and two large dorm rooms. Staff is very friendly and helpful, and hygiene is very good considering how much people it accommodates. Location is superb, within a short walking distance to dam, red light etc.
2014-03-15, Pretty small place with minimal facilities, but makes up for it by being in in a great location. Amsterdam is pretty expensive, but 18/14 Euro for a Weekend/Weekday bed is a little on the pricey end. Since megadorms are the only option here, you might get rudely interrupted by other drunk hostellers late at night if you're not into that sort of thing yourself.
2014-02-20, Nice, clean and cheap hostel. Close to everything ;)
2014-03-12, In general this was a good hostel. It's definitely well priced and was the cheapest we found in Amsterdam. The biggest issue we had was the lack of any common area; it's just a check in desk, two large dorms with beds and then a shared bathroom. The staff was helpful, and had plenty of maps. There is a one euro charge for towels, but lockers are free which is nice! I would definitely recommend bringing shower shoes though.
2014-02-17, This hostel was really great! We were very warmly welcomed. The room was really big and very clean. The bathroom was incredible!
2014-03-04, It's a good and cheap place if u wanna just sleep.. There are more hostels closer to the red light, which is where most of the things happen. I missed a place to meet new people.
2014-02-05, stayed 2 nights in a 4 bed private room. has private bathroom. really nice for the price. great location.
2014-02-06, No common areas, a little bit noisy in the room I stayed. Good if you're looking for a cheap hostel though.
2014-02-07, I stood in the 20 bed dorm and I like my experience very much. The room was very big so the 20 people had some space to move around and also the decoration was very nice. The showers and toilets very clean and the hostel is very weel situated just near by the central station.
2014-01-07, Perfect location, friendly and welcoming staff and I will definitely be coming back!
2011-03-11, 1) They should buy pesticides against moulds\r 2) Latted frames instead of card boards for ALL beds would be nice\r 3) Basins and shower only with folding door and not separated - can take ours till you can get in front of the mirror/basin\r 4) Not very logic, if you book a GIRLS ONLY room, but a room allocated to this one being for private use (or rented as well) and there are MALES in there crossing your FEMALE room several times a day without knocking\r 5) 10 persons in room + 2 "private" - 1 toilet
2014-03-07, This hostel was really cool! We wanted to find one of the cheapest place, where to stay during the night in downtown. Despite the fact we stood with 20 people in one room, no one disturbed the others and so we could sleep like Sleeping Beauties. Just expected the towel for free, which wasn´t (but just for 1 euro) and one of the shower was a bit weaker, but there was dryer (which saved my space in luggage). I can very recommend this hostel and definitely will stay there next time again!
2014-01-02, Best hostel ever!!!
2014-01-23, Good things: Excellent location, kind staff and suitable place to socialize with other people. Bad things: Baths and things smell a bit damp, no everyday cleaning, i didn't feel comfortable in bed. No plugs close to beds, for 22 people room, just 2 plugs which is senseless.
2014-01-02, Absolutely fantastic stay ! warm comfortable cosy beds ! Although I would have liked more socket points in the walls please! 2 plugs are not adequate for 20 people to share ! If at all possible place sockets by beds !?
2014-01-25, the room is very cool. we are from russia yet we still feel cold in the room. i suggest put some portable heater and some carpets on the floor. All and all, everything else is perfect.
2013-12-20, Extremely friendly and helpful Staff; I wish I had known that there is no living room there :P aprat from that, all great! Thank you!!
2011-10-03, The only thing that was missing was a room for everybody to hang out..and the kitchen only contains hot water cooker and a micro wave, so prepare for that ;).
2014-01-02, It's not worth the price. The hostel closes from 4 am until 6 am, during this time you can't go inside de hostel. They say everything closes at 1, not true, I saw myself leaving the party earlier because I didn't want to be lock outside, it was very cold. Everything looks durty and smells bad. No comum area, no kitchen, no place to charge phones, jus 2 wall outlets in a room with 22 people. I have been to amsterdam earlier and I can say this hostel can break the fun of the place.
2014-01-02, We stayed in a mixed dorm which was ok, the only problem was that some of the walls and some of the dorm was dirty- there was chewing gum stuck onto the wall next to my bed and some of the room mates were really loud....... which is to be expected in a room full of 20 people.
2013-12-21, there is no good atmosphere as you will find in most hostels because there is no living room where everyone can meet or no events organized to make people meet but other than that, everything is perfect. the room is clean and spacious and so well located ! I will recommend this hostel to any of my friends who would like to spend a few days in Amsterdam regardless what they want to do - shopping, clubbing, sightseeing - !
2013-11-15, Hostel is really close to city center.
2013-12-10, The hostel was in a brilliant location! Within walking distance of major attractions. The 10 bed female dorm was very large and pretty with a nice little balcony. The cooking facilities were simple but useful (fridge, microwave, kettle, freezer).The room had a decent sized en suite with a toilet, shower and bath (be careful the shower gets very hot). Radiators with temperature control meant I was never too hot.All in all great value for money as I only spent €25 for 3 nights. Highly recommended!
2013-07-24, Fairly good location, rooms were pretty horrendous, shared with well over 20 people even though our booking was with 20. The beds were extremely uncomfortable, and there was no communal area which would have at least improved it a bit
2013-12-06, Great hostel, great location close to dam square and the red light district. Super close to the station! We had a private room and it was huge with kitchen and bathroom and really nice views. Only bad thing was carrying bags up 5 stories but the building was old so it was understandable! Definitely would stay again!
2013-11-06, Great spot for startingnout in Amsterdam. Big dorms , great staff , and attractions/coffeeshops right around the corner
2014-01-03, Well localized and nice decoration. Common toilets for everyone, but I didn't have to wait to use. The staff on the first time was very gentle and helpful, on the other hand, in the morning everyone was rushed by an attendent which was in a very bad mood and we weren't even able to stay in the common area due to the cleaning, it was quite stressful. No kitchen, just a microwave and some appliances next to the wc's. The rest was ok.
2013-11-08, Expensive for a 20 beds dorm, really cold in the rooms at night and no possibilitiy to get an extra blanket, cold water in the shower. Unconvenient curfew, NO facilities (bikes rental, kitchen, bar, parties, pub crawls, free walking tours...).\r \r However awesome location, just 3 minutes walking from Jordaan, the Centraal Station and the Red Light District.
2013-10-15, Great price great location
2013-10-11, It is a good hostel for the price you pay.
2013-11-13, Adequate, but not exceptional. It did the job with no frills. It would have been great to have a communal area to talk / hang out. There was a couch in the female 10 bed dorm, but obviously when you want to chat with your friends at midnight this is not ideal for the people who are trying to sleep! Your other option was just a couple of couches in the reception area, which isn't great. \r \r Biggest turn off for me was that there was no door to the bathroom in the 10 bed female dorm!!!!
2013-10-26, A great little hostel to stay at if you want to be in the middle of everything! Stayed for 6nights Got to meet a lot of people! The owner and his wife were really helpful and super friendly and accommodating with useful information and tips while travelling! Owner was discussing renovations for the place and I think they have some great ideas in store! Would most certainly stay again at this hostel! PRIME location mins away from central station and bars/food market stores!!! :)
2013-10-09, The staff here were extremely rude and unhelpful. I was very very glad though I got moved to the female dorm, having a kitchen was a . You can find cheaper and better hostels. No atmosphere what so ever. Only good thing is the free towel and location.
2013-10-04, Excellent value for money. Clean as possible for a room for 20 people. More quiet and calme than the others hostels in the same area because is not a hostel/pub. The location and the very good internet are the best things.
2013-10-03, People sleeping there were not friendly. But of course you cannot do anything about it. Other than that, your hostel was perfect :)
2013-09-28, I stayed in the female only dorm which was really nicely decorated and set up. Good price, good location, would stay again if I visited amsterdam.
2013-09-25, Very good position; the staff was really kind and happy to give me all informations.
2013-09-28, Although this hostel was different from the ones I have stayed in, it had done its job. I had a blast here, it was very fun. I stays in a 10 bedroom female dorm and I love it! You didn't have much privacy in the bathrooms, but that only made it easier to chat with everyone
2013-09-19, A larger kitchen area would be needed, and if possible not right outside toilets and showers, which is kinda disgusting
2013-10-29, If I ever came back to Amsterdam I would definitely stay here again. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and accommodating to our group's needs, and overall the facilities were clean and pretty good, especially considering how cheap it was to stay there. The location was solid, about 10 minutes from Anne Frank House and the Red Light district, and then probably 25-30 minutes walking to the city center of Amsterdam (e.g. Vondelpark, Van Gogh museum, etc).
2013-09-18, Nice atmosphere in the dorm, friendly staff, super Location, fair Price - would definately come back!
2013-09-17, The kitchen consists of a fridge, kettle and microwave with some pots - which kind of limits your cooking options.
2013-09-12, room needed vacuming, and the hall way was also very dirty. Alot of staris!!
2013-09-13, We had to wait a few extra hours to check in when it specifically said 11 am on the paperwork. the room was not quiet and ten girls in one bathroom was a bit much but it was In a great location and clean overall.
2013-10-03, The best thing about Aivengo is the location: it's central to a ton of different things and walking distance from Centraal station (so no cab from the airport!), but just far away enough from the Red Light District that the street was cute and uncrowded and quiet-ish at night. The staff wasn't especially friendly, but the beds, room and bathroom all were clean. We stayed in the 10-bed female dorm, which had its own kitchen and bathroom. Don't expect anything fancy, but it is a great deal!
2013-08-28, The room was really spacious and clean along with being very close to the station! Would definitely stay there again if I went back to Amsterdam :)
2013-09-10, Had a 3-4 hour wait when we arrived although we were told it would be ready. Room was unclean. Room was freezing. Stayed at the Movenpick hotel in the city centre before and it was roughly the same price(on offer) and was amazing compared to this 'hostel'.
2013-09-01, I thought the value was good for what this hostel offered but it was most definitely not the best hostel experience I have ever had.
2013-08-27, Great location. We stayed in a twin-private, which was super cute and clean. Had to climb a lot of stairs, but the beautiful common area and kitchen are worth it.
2013-08-22, Simply put, this is a place to sleep. Don't expect a common room or kitchen because there's not. Only a microwave and mini fridge. Aside from that the best part about the hostel is its location which is an easy walk to the station and historic/nightlife spots.
2009-07-15, Perfect. Amsterdam Cribs is the best hostel I have ever been. The manager is very kind, helped us a lot. The room is clean and tidy, as well as the kitchen.
2013-09-02, In an excellent location, for those interested very close to the red light district. But thats about it, probably one of the cheapest hostels we could find, but it shows. Huge rooms with 20 people, I could feel every bar on my bed as I was sleeping and the toilets, common room, reception and showers are all in the same room
2013-08-16, didnt feel clean.
2013-08-20, Lovely spacious room. The only downsides were the lack of kitchen facilities (just a microwave) and the lack of common room. A nice hostel, one of the cheapest in Amsterdam - would recommend!
2013-08-14, We took a room for 4 persons. It was like having a small flat in the center of Amsterdam!
2013-08-14, Staff very relaxed and tolerant, loved the hostel, the only thing that sucked - matresses are too thing making the sleeping uncomfortable
2013-08-11, One of the staff at night is not very helpful.
2013-08-18, Staff could be more professional, i don't ask for top hat and tails reception but think all male members of staff should wear a t-shirt! Nice room, good view, good bathrooms. Rooms all clean.
2013-08-12, I was in a 10 female bed dorm; it was quite spacious and had a great view outside! The beds were basically cots and while not super comfortable, definitely noisy. The location makes this place! There's no common room/lounge, which is unfortunate but again the location is great!
2013-08-07, They cancelled my booking because of the arrival time.
2013-08-08, Very good location, close to the train station and the city center ! But no commun leaving room or real kitchen (just a tiny fridge and a micro-wave). Fine if you want just have somewhere to sleep, but unpleasant to stay during the day, not convivial at all. Doors are always open and the staff not watching on.
2013-08-11, Aivengo Hostel is totally amazing! I stayed in a room with other 9 girls for 3 nights and everything was perfect. The staff was very kind and the room was clean and very comfortable, also the position is perfect to visit Amsterdam: just 2 minutes walking from the Dam. I really reccomend it!
2013-08-08, An average hostel. Located very close to central station; easy to find. Very close to the street, so it was pretty loud at nights. it was nice that it was non-smoking. Staff were friendly enough. The place was cleaned every morning, and surprisingly clean everywhere, especially for being in a 20 bed dorm. No common area; in general it was a pretty standard hostel for a good price, centrally located, but nothing special.
2013-08-05, Incredibly near everything, great staff, secure, always a very clean place (stood there for 10 days). There is indeed some problems, but that's why is called a youth hostel: I (we) don't care. Best benefit-cost.
2013-08-01, Very dingy spot. The hostel needs WAY more cleaning. Staff merely mopped. Staff also could be more friendly. Only pros are the location and the wifi.
2013-08-01, The hostel was the worst hostel i have ever been. I will never go to that place again. Horrible staff, smelly rooms, no security for your stuff. It was horrible. Totally not worth the money.
2013-07-31, Warning! The doors close at 4am and don't open until 6am and you are not allowed back in until 6am. They won't let you open the door to let anyone in either. Very stupid rule. The staff member was still there even after the doors were closed. It made no sense and sleeping on the street in front of the hostel wasn't fun. I will not stay here again or any place with a curfew.
2013-08-03, Security was only average because it had lockers for valuables. The code to get in the rooms is easy to guess because you can see on the keypad. Atmosphere was rubbish. Beds are way to close together I felt like I was sleeping with the guy in the adjacent bed his head as so close to me. Area isn't that nice but was close to the station. If I was to visit Amsterdam again I'd stay out nearer the museumplein.
2013-07-30, I stayed in a separate apartment with 3 friends. We were walked over by a staff member and shown everything we needed to know and got a city map that was extremely useful. The room was very basic but clean and comfortable, location was great close to everything. No problems at all felt safe and comfortable.
2013-07-30, Overall decent hostel for the price. However, our 'ten bed female room' consistently had twelve girls in it, eleven beds and a mattress on the floor. We also had issues with a male staff walking in the room while girls were changing, no knock or any warning at all. Location was great, close to all.
2013-07-04, We booked a 12 bed room and it was very spacious, we all had plenty of space and we were given our own lockers for a small deposit. The location was perfect, it was in walking distance of central station and the majority of other sites in Amsterdam.
2011-09-17, The kitchen is a joke!
2013-07-25, Location is great. Two blocks walk from Central station. Ten Minute walk to red light/Mid Daam. And the street outside is almost never deserted, which is a plus for a girl like me who was travelling alone. \r \r I stayed in a 11 bed female dormitory. It was very cute, and the facilities were decent minus the fact that we didnt have hot water for two nights. But that got fixed pretty quick. \r \r I would stay in this hostel again. It's location is great.
2013-08-02, Good thing about this property is the location and they have lockers.\r \r Bad things: there is no kitchen (only microwave), there is a curfew (would be amazing if they had told that when I was checking in), no living room/chill out area, they switch on the lights in the rooms at 9am (WTF?!!) and put some loud music so everyone wakes up in time for check out. There are two very nice receptionists but the other two were so rude and helpless and the beds are very uncomfortable. \r \r Hope this helps!
2013-07-25, Very good location!\r Shower without hot water, loud because it is in the centre, horrible stairs...
2013-07-27, I was in a group of four when we arrived and the staff upgraded us to a private room for four. This was fabulous. The room however was a few blocks down from the hostel- basically we had our own apartment from which we could come and go privately. This was very nice except we had no atmosphere, no chance to meet other people. We never went back to the main hostel except for check out. If you're looking to meet people and have the excitement of hostel life, this might prove disappointing.
2009-06-20, We'd stay there again for sure.
2013-07-24, I really loved this hostel. The room was clean and big. The only bad thing is that u have to climb a lot of small stairs but all the buildings in Amsterdam center are like that. The location is close to the Red Light District but it is a safe street and no noisy.
2013-07-22, I made the discumfortable discovery that my bed was partly broken (the steel bed base was partly unsoldered) and thus almost prevented me to sleep.\r Besides, there hardly is anything to cook : only a microwave hoven and some dishes. There wasn(t even a table and some chairs to seat around.
2013-07-15, Great location although the five flights of stairs was a bit of a shock, great view from the top though!
2013-07-14, Was decent enough for 2 nights but the flooring was ripped and wasn't too clean. Looked like it needed a lick of paint. \r Good location though.
2013-07-14, Very clean place, the staff was very helpful and the location was great, its near the red light and central station
2013-07-11, Loved this hostel!!! Great location and nice clean rooms. Kitchen with refrigerator & a bathroom in the room. This hostel is nice because it is close to everything and a quiet place to come home to after a night out.
2013-07-18, Basically a big room with 10 single beds but because it was so big you didnt feel cramp at all and no bunks which was great. There is an ensuite and a kitchenette. Everything is expensive in Amsterdam but this was confortable and in a good location making it a short walk - met some lovely Girls in the all female dorm.
2013-07-09, For the price, this hostel could use more plugs, more personnal rooms, a lobby...
2013-07-13, Stayed for 2 weeks it was spot on. Mattresses a little on the thin side and yes they do just fold up the blankets for the next person but, you regularly see the showers and toilets being cleaned as well as the rooms being swept. And a hip hop/rap wake-up call every morning, cool.
2013-07-10, Bizarrely decorated. Good location to the north part of Amsterdam though we found it quite hard to find. Wifi wasn't great and computers were very slow. It was extremely small, not great for meeting people. It had lockers but they didn't seem that hard to break into, though our stuff remained safe. Stayed for 3 nights, the third night was a Friday and the price doubled which made the stay no where near worth the money.
2013-07-09, The location is great, and the staff is very friendly. The place is rather small, and it's a little unconfortable in that sense, but otherwise it's a good choice
2013-07-09, Of all the places we had stayed on our trip, this hostel was one of the best. Really really spacious rooms with a ensuite bathroom and kitchen (although not working at the time). Fairly central, a bit further up the road, but really close to Centraal station (only about 5-10 minute walk) and everything in Amsterdam is walkable/cyclable anyway. Really would recommend this hostel!
2013-12-20, Aivengo is a quite well located hostel.I stayed with a friend for 2 nights,and we were satisfied.There were no special safety facilities for your luggage.Everything there was a safe,where you should leave as a deposit 10 euros in the reception and use the key until you go away.In general it was a good hostel.One annoying thing was the curfew between 4 and 6 am,which make you rush back to the hostel,in the chance of being locked out up to 6 am,one thing you should really bear in mind..
2013-07-06, This hostel was a big disapointment. They did not have a kitchen, the staff were unhelpful and unfriendly, it seemed like the place, especially the toilets never got cleaned. I would not reccomend this hostel to anyone.
2013-07-03, Aivengo was great, friendly welcoming atmosphere, fantastic location and very good value for money. I will definately be going back at some point.
2013-07-02, Very well situated, i just wish it would have been a little bit more clean. Great place to meet people.
2013-07-01, It's very basic, but clean, safe and very central :)
2013-06-28, Staff is absolutely amazing. They go out of their way to make you feel at home.
2013-07-08, Not much space to meet other people, but there's lots to do around! 5 min walk to Dam Square and Red Light District plus all the best coffee shops, 10 mins to Anne Frank house, 20 to the big museums and Vondelpark. Staff was very accommodating and diligent. You can still certainly meet other travelers, but an actual common room and kitchen would be excellent. Not the cleanest but I found everyone who stayed there tried their hardest to be respectful of the space and keep it clean.
2012-12-29, The beds are very bad, and you only have a small blanket, so at night you could freeze.
2013-07-06, the showers were very poorly installed and needed fixing. there was grime down the sides of my bed and only a mattress liner, no actual mattress like the other beds so ended up using two mattress liners and doubling them up. seriously need double glazing! it was so clear to hear everything outside i may as well of slept on the pavement with my mattress liners.
2013-06-24, The hostel had a good location, but the facilities were poor. Just a refridgerator in the bathroom and there were'nt really a "hang out spot" there. But for for a night or two it works just fine!
2013-06-20, I had an awesome experience here. Everything was great, the staff could have definitely been more friendly though!
2013-06-18, Really enjoyed my stay in Amsterdam would definetly stay at the Aivengo hostel again if I went back to Amsterdam.
2013-06-23, The 20 bed room is pretty easy to get into but you get a locker so not fussed. Missing a common room to meet people if you are a single traveller. Staff were great, location is good, I walked everywhere easily. Wifi everywhere too which is nice. Good value for money of tou are on a budget
2013-06-18, Staff was not kind at all. She just did her job. She did not have any hospitality. I reported something and she ignored, which did not show me if she understood my report or not.\r The entrance atmosphere was bad. It scared me staying there.
2013-06-19, Booking 2 weeks in advance, this was the cheapest hostel we could find (17 euros a night!!). Good location and helpful staff. Except they started playing dubstep at 8.30am and turning the lights on of our dorm and leaving the door open. Very few plugs and seriously uncomfortable beds. Felt like lying on a bed of springs.
2013-06-16, Very good hostel with helpful staff you help us charge our devices. Good atmosphere with very nice guests who were happy to share their experiences. Bathroom and toilets were clean enough.
2013-06-20, Good location next to centraal station and walking distance to most of the tourist attractions. Only criticisms would be that the bed wasn't that great and there was no communal area for meeting people, although the dorm turned out to be quite a fun place to drink! It was nice having wi-fi in the room as well. Would recommend for the price that we paid.
2013-06-11, A fair hostel for the price but lacked any atmosphere. No communal sitting area or kitchen didn't help.
2013-06-11, Not coming back..
2013-06-12, Cozy hostelet with a bohemian feel to it an a very helpful staff! Could use some better curtains/window blinders but at least we got up in time ;) The location was the best!! Easy access to all of the city, will def. recommend it to other friends.
2013-06-11, Bathrooms were really clean, but the floors were somewhat dirty. Couldn't have asked for a better location.
2013-06-08, The guy reception was very helpful. 20 bed dorm was spacious. Open plan 10 female was nice (no 'real', but fridge, microwave, kettle, plate etc..)
2013-06-04, Stay for 3 nights.\r Room is big. Staffs are helpful.\r Only 2 plugs in a 10 ppl dorm.\r No kitchen.\r Overall not bad. Recommended.
2013-06-17, From reading other reviews of this hostel I was weary of going to stay there but on my arrival i found the hostel very nice! The staff were not that friendly but its fine because you dont see them that much! I stayed in a 10 bed female dorm which was very nice but the stairs was very steep and alot of it! so I would suggest staying in a dorm 10 beds or less because the bad reviews are from the doorms that are about 20 beds.
2013-06-09, a toilet seat is the least i expect, this hostel is not in India. hardly any power points to charge things, most awful mattresses ever (unless i was very unlucky) and no common area despite being told there was. and i hope you don't like windows, because there weren't any.
2013-06-01, Enjoyed the stay, and liked the view on Amsterdam's streets (room on the 5th floor)
2013-06-04, Cool Scottish chick working on Reception -- gave us some nice tips. An easy to find hostel, right near Centraal Station and main tram line. Probably could've done with thicker blankets as we got cold sleeping! Friendly atmosphere though and clean showers/toilets. Would recommend.
2013-05-30, Good location and decent price. The set up of the hostel is weird. The bathroom is in the lobby, it's kind of one big room. There are no toilet seats in any of the bathroom stalls. The front door is also always left unlocked/wide open, even at night. Overall, It was okay but Im sure there are better hostels out there.
2013-05-30, The 4 floor climb up to the girls dorm was a bit trecherous, but once up there the room was amazing. The staff could have done with having a bit more local knowledge altrhough I found them very friendly. Overall- a very good stay.The best thing has to be the location!
2013-05-25, The staff were rude, and I felt very unsafe and scared there.
2013-05-24, Not impressed... Bring your own blanket they don't clean the ones left on the bed... Also don't forget shower shoes
2013-07-21, The 10 bed female dorm was huge, and it was nice that the beds were not bunks. It was good to have a kitchen in the same room, however, the cooker was out of order. The staff were not friendly when we were checking in, and we were also told we would not be able to have lockers. The big windows that faced out onto the street had to be kept open because of the heat, but it was v noisy at night. The location was good, the dorm atmosphere was friendly, but would've been good to have a common room.
2013-06-10, The hostel is painted in crazy bright colors, and looks like it was a fun place once; but everything from the lack of common space to the awkward shower/bathrooms and not even tea made this one of the worst hostels I've stayed in. The location is convenient, though--a couple blocks from the main train station.
2013-05-18, It was very nice staying in Aivengo Hostel.\r The only thing to criticize are the bedclothes because the could not have been changed. In other words that is not really hygienic.
2013-05-19, Very fun and colorful hostel! Some of the mattresses in the big dorms are a bit saggy, but the atmosphere was really nice.\r The only thin I missed was a common room or a real kitchen, but for the price you really cannot complain. Will stay again when I'm in Amsterdam next time!
2013-05-26, price and location were good, this is not a bad hostel but the beds were not the most comfortable and i dont think they should be listed as having a kitchen, as it is a fridge and a microwave so you cant really cook proper meals. no toilet seats too
2013-05-16, the staff were super unfriendly and had no suggestions of good places to go and did not want to socialize, which is not what a hostel should be like. but the room was nice, but a bit overpriced.
2013-05-06, Good hostel! Good location as well.
2013-05-05, Good hostel,Location is great.only the badhroom and toilets not clean so much.
2013-05-05, Cool location. Too bad that there are no toilet seats. clean and good value.
2013-05-17, It was very cold, there were no heat on and no real blankets, the pillow and the bed was not very good also. There is no louge in the hostel and the female dorm is on the 4th floor, no elevator, different entrance, didn't feel very safe. It was not what I expected form the information on hostelworld.com and from the photos.
2013-05-14, Great room with kitchenette and great Dutch row house character. Located just outside of the red light district 5 minutes away from both the train station and the main square, it was the perfect location to start exploring Amsterdam.
2013-05-01, it is good for sleeping.
2013-04-23, Everything is lovely, but there're no lifts! I lived on the 5th floor and no lift!
2009-06-06, Fantastically managed. We were always asked if we needed anything- which we never did. Well equipped kitchen. Our expectations were exceeded.
2013-05-24, I knew it was going to be an interesting experience staying in a 20 bed dorm room, however this hostel was worse than expected. The beds were uncomfortable like sleeping directly on the springs, they may say there are kitchen facilities but its a bar fridge in a corner with a kettle and microwave directly that is opposite the showers. Each morning at 9am, regardless if you are checking out, the staff open the doors to the room and play loud music to make sure people wake 1 hour before checkout.
2013-04-18, The bed is not comfortable..
2013-04-18, It was ok
2013-04-18, It was very cold as others had mentioned....the bathrooms were strange- right off the check-in with a curtain in front of them.
2013-04-16, A really nice hostel everyone was friendly and it was very clean! and in a great location!
2013-04-20, I stayed in a ten-girl room, the girls got out late in the night and returned in the midnight, talked loud,etc...kind of hard to get some good sleep.Shower gets cold if more than one person take a quick shower one after another. But the hostel is very close to the central station...
2013-05-03, The room I stayed in - 16 all female - was very loud, bright, and the stove didn't work. More than anything, I was disappointed by the other women staying in my room - loud and disrespectful. The only lights are floor lamps, so when they turned them on at 4 a.m., the entire room lit up. Otherwise, the hostel is sufficient, clean enough, with nice staff and a good location. Good value for money, don't expect anything fancy, but its nice enough. May be cold in the winter - only one fleece blanket
2013-04-12, The receptionist is nice and friendly. The en suite quad room is perfect but the heater was not really working so it was quite cold at night!
2013-05-10, Security was very lax for the two 20-person rooms: the front door to the hostel is always open, and the doors to each of the two 20-person dorms were often kept hanging open. This meant that if there's no one at reception/if you look like someone who would be using the hostel (they did stop a homeless-looking guy), no one bats an eye when you walk in.\r The atmosphere is sub-par, the "kitchen" is really just a kettle and a microwave IN THE WASHROOM. But the staff is nice, and great location.
2013-04-03, The staff was always skyping or on facebook, just a bit awkward. Also the front door has no lock and neither do the rooms, so theoretically people could walk right in. We weren't given keycards or anything, it was just a walk-in walk-out type thing. None of our stuff was stolen but we definitely felt the need to lock up our stuff.
2013-04-02, The only good thing is the location!! Cold shower, thin matresses, barely a pillow and barely a blanket so it was freezing! Every time someone walked upstairs their footsteps on the stairs were ridiculously loud.
2013-03-31, I recommend :)
2013-04-03, The only good aspect in this hostel is the location, because the rest is awful. The room is full (22 people) and there is no window. We have to pass in the reception to go to the toilet and showers, so embarrassing! There is a microwave oven and a little fridge inside the toilet, terrible!! Someone stole the blanket of my friend and there isn't another one. Inside the room is very cold! Also, bed sheet and pillow smell bad. Staff are not very polite and simply didn't solve our problems!
2013-03-29, The hostel is expensive, in general really poor, the location is the only good factor. Bathrooms are the worse. You will be lucky if you could have a hot shower...
2013-04-08, Our stay was perfect as far as we are concerned. We stayed on the 6th floor in the double room and had gorgeous views all around the city. It had loads of storage space and a balcony as well as a huge bay window that opened to views of the Westerkerk and Dam Square. This was a beautiful place to stay, and they were very friendly- our room was more like a flat or a party pad with loads of space. The only downside was being on the 6th floor without a microwave or hob, but we did have a fridge.
2013-03-29, Great location, nice layout of the room, glad to see single beds and not bunk beds. One bathroom between 10 was rough and not the cleanest but the location beats all of that.
2013-04-05, It was a cute hostel. We stayed in the 10bed female dorm. It hasn't got an elevator (we had to go up to the fifth floor from the stairs) but the room was nice and clean! It has a really tiny kitchen (microwave and fridge-so if you want to have a snack,breakfast or a quick meal it's ok-not for actual cooking) It is in the center of the city, near the dam square. We actually enjoyed our stay there.
2012-12-05, It was in a fantastic location, walking distance from many places. The only problem we had was it was freezing inside the hostel as well as outside. If you go during the winter, bring clothes to layer.
2013-05-03, Great location, nice people working, gave us lots of advice as to where to go and see, i enjoyed my stay !! only downfalls (in the mixed dorm) were that the bathroom stalls were open to everyone, very small space inside the bathroom and no toilet seats, also always smelt bad, some beds were awful in terms of the mattress there was barely even one and it felt like you were sleeping on wood. a very small thin blanket was provided so we were often cold at night. the female dorm was must nicer !
2013-03-17, We have been staying in this hostel in march 2013. The stuff was very friendly and helpful. Thanks for great athmosphere, you made our stay in Amsterdam unforgettable. Will come back soon! :)
2013-03-27, defi great location but i guess you will get what you paid, compared to other hostels in Amsterdam. no social place unless you start talking ppl in the room... if you are staying one night probably not so bad but if you wanna stay longer... search other hostels
2013-03-21, I stayed in the female dormitory for 2 nights. The environment there was excellent. It was very safe as it got the lockers to keep the things and other backpackers were very decent and clean. The staff was very helpful and gave us a map!\r However, the wifi signal there was not very strong and my phone was always disconnected.
2013-03-08, Nice rooms perfect location.
2012-12-02, I had no where to hang out at this hostel. The staff wernt very helpful, and the door room was aweful. I felt like I was sleeping in a military hospital. The complimentary bedding is on thin scratchy wollen blanket. I had to sleep fully dressed wearing a jacket. I would not stay here again.
2013-03-29, I don't recommend this hostel. I stayed in an all female room for a weekend and was extremely underwhelmed. The staff was ok, the rooms were not as cold as a previous review had stated, but it was not a welcoming place. We had about 10 people in a bare-bones room with thin, see-through curtains--it felt a bit like an old hospital. \r If you really need a place to stay, the location is it's only redeeming quality. It wasn't horrible or gross, it was just not worth the money I was spending!
2013-03-17, The only trouble I faced was the absence of hot water at morning. All the rest was cool. The attitude of personnel was good. Thank you very much :)
2013-03-23, Despite of the bad weather in Amsterdam, the rooms were warm and clean, but we had to go 6 floors upstairs everyday, and it was tiring. But it was sure that nobody were to rob us on this height. \r The location is perfect (only 5 minutes from the Central Station). I recommend it
2013-02-28, The only thing I could complain is that the room was freezing, and the beds and blanket the cheapest I have ever seen.
2013-02-23, Very good hostel, nice staff, safe. One problem: we had only one blanket and it was quite cold...
2013-03-15, This hostel was unbelievably cold and not worth the money we paid. In a large room there were only 2 small heaters, and the blankets were unbelievably thin. On request for an extra blanket, we were refused, and the staff were not the friendliest in the world. If you are going to stay in this hostel, I would advise taking a sleeping bag or an extra blanket.
2013-02-24, Staff is very friendly, the room was nice (8 person dorm), we expected some horror for 11 euro. Location is great - 5 minutes to the Centraal stations. \r The Dam square is also in 5 minutes walk. \r Huge minus - the cooker wasn't working even thougg was promised.
2013-02-22, There are very thin blankets in large rooms so at night you would freeze. Otherwise, it was nice.
2013-03-07, There is nothing wrong with the hostel persay, however it was freezing - you are given one small blanket and no sheets. I had to sleep in almost all of my clothes every night. There is no common area which makes it almost impossible to meet others. And the hostel is closed from four to six AM... All of the bars and clubs close right around four so you either have to come back early or stay out really late.
2013-03-02, We realised that the 'door code' to get into our room was redundant and that we did not need to enter a code to access our room. To get in and out you do have to go past the reception, but that and the provided lockers are thus the only elements of security provided. Also, the room was very cold; I suggest either providing duvets instead or thin blankets or turning the temperature up. Kitchen is also not a kitchen - only a microwave and a fridge. Friendly staff and good atmosphere though!
2013-02-07, Fantastic experience! Location can't be beat and staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.
2013-02-23, Probably the worst Hostel I've ever stayed at. The staff just sat behind their desk doodling on the computer, the beams from the bunk bed stuck through the mattress, the sheet was just a thin wollen blanket. What little of a kitchen there is, is in the bathroom which is also in the reception. Also there is no common room so the Hostel has no atmosphere at all whatsoever. The only thing going for this Hostel is its location
2013-02-22, The hostel didnt have a common area that we found and the rooms where next to the hostel shard with a block of flats, which was fine but its not a place to meet people. \r The room was very big, clean and included a fridge and an onsuite which we liked,and the staff were really friendly and helpful. I would stay here again, but only with friends.
2013-02-15, It was clean enough and I didn't feel unsafe at all. However, the room on the bottom floor is underneath stairs and my bed was also right next to the window, which I didn't mind, but it is something people may want to be aware of. There is also no where to hang out, so plan on only sleeping there.
2013-01-18, All is perfect
2013-01-25, Rooms in another building, no common rooms, the room was cold ...and my bed was next to the heater!! But the girls room is big, has is own kitchen and the location is good. Near the train station.
2012-12-29, No mirror?!
2013-01-25, They pretty much just have two giant rooms with probably 16 beds or so. It was also freezing, there were only one or two radiators in this room and it was below freezing outside. The one blanket provided was not really enough so many of us covered up with our jackets or just slept in them. The staff were very friendly though, and there are lockers to store your stuff.
2013-02-08, I'm not sure if it was a 10 or 12 person room, but there were quite a few of us in one large room. There was one bathroom, a kitchenette and lockers. I felt safe because we were all girls. It could get a little frustrating (as with any large room) because everyone is on different time schedules. The shower head was broken which was a little annoying but nothing you can't deal with! Overall the hostel was good for our needs, great location!
2012-12-07, Hostel was closed from 4 -6 am. for the two night i stayed in Amsterdam, that when i got back to hostel, it was shut., so i had stand outside the hostel till it will open. to very impracticable i believe especially when it Amsterdam who knows when people will come back and want to sleep?
2012-12-07, I was very disappointed not to find any common area in this hostel : no real kitchen ( too close from the sanitary, and without any equipment). There are also no place to meet people (sofa, tables, tv room ...). I expected common area in an hostel.\r I was also very surprise to have just a small blanket ( that you don't clean ) for my bed. The night in Amsterdam are so cold and I was freezing in my bed. \r Then the mix dorm close from the entrance is a freezer, the heating is not working ...
2013-01-02, We were in a 5th floor dorm - no lift, lots of stairs! The room was spacious with a couch, coffee table, fridge, microwave, kettle and cutlery,etc. there was a seperate toilet and 2 sinks along with a shower in the bathroom. An extra shower would make it better but it was manageable (except when one of the girls took a half hour shower one night).
2012-11-30, Amazing location, cool, chilled out staff, value for money. Clean, ideal
2006-04-03, I stayed in a personal flat with 5 of my friends. We had a blast and would recommend this site for anyone. :-) Have fun!
2013-01-18, The staff were incredible and although we were supposed to arrive at 2pm they waiting until 2am to check us in. Very friendly and helpful and would go again. We stayed in the all-girls dorm which only had one other person in at a time, so it was really nice as we felt we had the whole place to ourselves. In a very accessible place, very close to the central station, but if you look it up on google maps it shows its on a different part of that road. So don't trust google maps.
2012-11-27, it's ok...
2012-11-23, not the best, still it is good enough for short stay.
2012-12-02, I stayed in the 10 person female dorm. It was okay but not very good. My bed was terrible, you should renew some. It was okay clean but many hair on the floor in the room that is the kitchen/bathroom. There is no common room for the whole hostel and no kitchen where you could meet other people than the people in your room so I would recommend it to people travelling in groups.
2012-11-16, The room was fantastic. The unic fail is that they don't have rooms for 5 persons. Ten persons in one room is too much. But the rest was ok!!
2012-11-30, did not like shower ad bathroom set up which is pretty much in the "lobby" area. not very good security but u can rent lockers if u'd like. staff was not too helpful with things. but its amesterdam and you're really just looking for a place to rest ur head thats not amazingly clean and nice. but it was kinda pricey compared to other hostels i have been to for less quality and value
2012-11-16, great hostel, stayed in the 10 bed female dorm and loved the set up and personal kitchen. also love the view from the room and the location right next to centraal station and red light district.
2012-11-29, The hostel is great for it's location, but otherwise it's just a place to sleep. Staff were always very friendly and helpful. Be warned: there are only a few outlets available for use, so if you need to charge anything it can be quite difficult. There's not really a common area, so it can be hard to meet fellow travelers.
2012-11-16, The receptionist was very friendly and willing to explain the city map. The Hostel is ideally located, within walking distance of a lot of things. The room where I stayed was actually quite spacious and a was sharing the room with 9 other girls!
2012-11-09, best location just in the city center all needed sightseeings withing 15min walking. nice staff. the only disadvantage is that there was no common room to chill and hang out
2012-11-14, It's good place, the staff are very friendly, the beds are good, but the rooms are not so clean.
2012-11-29, Facilities are quite in a bad shape, old and it was really cold at night, i even asked for another blanket and they said no. What was really not ok, was the stuff - they were extremely unfriendly. It was like in the army, no smile or hello, strict "give me passport and money". Kitchen is not a kitchen, there is just microwave. I wanted to print 1 page of my bus ticket, they charged me 0,5 eur. In room with 20 bed these are 2 electricity plug-ins. There is no common place to hang out.
2012-11-04, Great location and price, staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms and bathrooms were always clean. However there was a lack of communal space and kitchen area, and 2 plug sockets to share between 20! Overall great value for money and would definitely stay here again!
2012-11-02, The staff were friendly enough, and quite helpful. The place is kept clean. The price per night drastically increases on the weekend, so factor that in when planning your trip. Amsterdam is a blast on weeknights too... My only issue was that there isn't much of a lounge... and subsequently a lack of atmosphere.
2012-11-08, Its located on a very cool street in Amsterdam but it isnt too noisy or busy in front of the hostel, so that was very good. But it wasnt very clean in the room and also looked a bit run down to be honest. Also there is a huge problem of space in the hostel. I think they should work on the subject: cleanliness! apart from this it was very good and also affordable and free luggage romm for check out guests!
2012-10-27, Incredibly easy-going, accommodating, helpful staff. Always down for small talk and giving great recommendations. There's a high turn over of guests, which makes the large bedrooms exciting and dynamic (if sometimes noisy at night, with random snores and the ringing phones of heavy sleepers). Classic, quality hostel experience. And don't get me started on how perfect the location is.
2012-10-25, Had such an amazing time in Amsterdam. I found the staff really helpful, they offered great advice. The only downside to the place was the lack of kitchen, there's some cutlery, a microwave and a fridge but not much space to prepare food and eating out is a little pricey. I found the beds really comfy though. I was sad to leave, thank you so much.
2008-11-18, Great place to stay, good location and friendly staff, will stay here again nxt time!!
2012-10-20, We were very surprised at how good our stay here was. The hostel was lovely, big and clean; the beds were comfortable and the location was brilliant. The guy who greeted us was really helpful and overall we had a great trip.
2012-10-21, It was quite cheap to stay at Aivengo but that was unfortunately the only draw card. The staff were very unfriendly and not very helpful. The 'kitchen' was 1 microwave situated in the toilet room. The beds were awful and the bedding provided was too small to provide any warmth at all. The worst factor was being woken up every morning around 8 when the staff opened the dorm doors (right next to reception), turned on the lights and played loud dance music. 0 stars.
2012-10-20, Definitely a great value. It's right near the train station and super cheap. The rooms are really quiet so you are sure to get a good night's sleep. I would definitely recommend it if you are traveling light. However If you have a suitcase it won't fit in the lockers so you have to keep it under your bed or in an unlocked closet at your own risk. The girls-only room is a 4-floor walk-up, but it's even more private and has a cuter bathroom & huge bay window with a nice view.
2012-10-21, I stayed for 3 days. Noisy until 4am- receptionist turn on the music until 4 am!! Crazy..\r At night, it's so cold.. Don't heat it up and blanket is so thin!!\r So I asked for print my ticket to receptionist, he wants to get money, it's okay(0.50) but,,,,the print is poor, I couldn't see the letter!!!! What's that?\r Staff is not goot ..(woman staff is kind) anyway I don't like it everything!
2012-10-17, Beds are thin and the pillows too but baths and showers are very clean. \r Not a real common area so everyone stand on his own but i'll suggest this hostel as a place to stay just for few days.\r It is also well located and it is ok for the money spent! :)
2012-10-18, The location was excellent,perfect for a tourist that just needs a place to rest. Just a walking distance to all the famous sights and also to the railwaystation.\r \r The room was clean and big but there was only one toilet/bathroom for ten girls. I always left so early that it wasn't much of a problem, though. Also, being in the center and all, it wasn't that quiet during the night. And the cooker didn't work which would've been a problem if I had stayed more than three nights.
2012-10-11, not enough powerpoints. reception is closed from 4 till 6 am. lots of street noise. but great location
2012-10-27, Overall it is a good hostel, I didn't eally like the bathroom since they were too small and in the showers you didn't have any space to put your clothes and it all just got very wet, they're not very clean but it is good if you're just pending a couple of nights there. The beds are a little noisy but everyone was very respectful with the things and didn't make a lot of noise.
2012-09-28, showers and toilets are more or less open and not very comfortable
2012-10-12, I really enjoyed staying at the Aivengo. It was good value for money, the room had a private shower and a locker which was awesome, and the receptionist (don't know his name!) was really friendly. Can't complain! Already recommended it to a friend and will be back if I'm in Amsterdam. :)
2012-10-13, Aivengo Hostel is really nice (just for the private room), good quality and good price ^^\r The next time in Amsterdam I will choose the same hostel but I speak about the private room for 4 persons
2012-10-02, Location was really good, staff was also pretty good. Bathrooms were also quite good but really open to the front desk (but thats alright since everything's got a door anyway). Oh and free computers - big plus!\r On the negative side - the mattresses weren't the most comfortable i've had, pretty thin. And also there was no common room so hanging out in the hostel is a bit awkward.
2012-09-21, Clean, friendly and a good location. For a short stay, it is perfect!
2012-09-26, Great location, could walk from anywhere easily, including the Centraal Station. Lockers were ok, but my biggest complaint is that we were just given a throw blanket and small pillow for our bed. For Amsterdam weather this is not enough, and the rooms were drafty too.
2012-10-10, We stayed in the 8-person female dorm because it was described to have a full kitchen. Upon arrival, we discovered the burners and stove top were out of order, and there was no oven. We were able to keep our food in the refrigerator and use the microwave and toaster to piece together a camping-style dinner, but don't expect to actually be able to cook.
2012-09-21, I loved staying at this hostel, but was disappointed that it was closed from 4-6am and that for the women's dorm only one key was given to us for 3 people. I was separated from my group and the other members had to wait until 6am to be given a key.
2012-09-17, all in all this hostel does the job, it provides a bed and a shower and really what else do you need. However it really lacks on the social front. There are no common areas, so basically you are confined to your bed. But that being said it was in a good location and it was clean, so really i can't complain.
2012-09-15, The location of this hostel was really good, walking distance to everything, however the beds were horrible. Thin mattresses, you can feel the metal beams, and you are only provided with a thin blanket. Amsterdam can be cold in September so it's not really enough. A common room wouldn't go astray either. Not a terrible stay, but not great either for the price you have to pay.
2012-09-19, We thought there will be shampoo and soap provided but sadly,no :(
2012-09-10, Great hostel and would defiantly go back!
2012-09-12, Great experience at this hostel, would highly recommend, especially if visiting in a large group. Great value for money and ideal location. Couldn't have asked for much more considering what we paid.
2012-09-14, We got there on Friday night and my twin room wasn't in the main building. The other building is not good. Even the main on wasn't good as looked like in the pictures that you showed in the website. The staff was rude when we asked simple questions and there was no light in the room.
2011-08-10, the girls 10 bed doom is great....it has a kitchen (with the basics) and bathroom- its basically a loft with everything you need on one floor with a nice view... great way to meet other girls aswell.
2012-09-23, Realy needs a common room, theres no social aspect to this place at all, the only place you have to relax is your bed. You can't buy anything there, you can't meet anyone because you want to be out of bed in the morning but everyones asleep when you get back. Great location, clean and had a kitchen in my dorm, plus a locker.\r Female staff member came in late morning to do something in the kitchen but bought her son in which was awkward in a female dorm when everyones getting ready, didn't knock.
2012-09-05, Rooms upstairs had tv and were of much higher quality than the room we were put in.
2012-09-09, I stayed in two different all female dorms and one of the 20 person mixed dorms. The female dorms were wonderful. Bright and cheerful with big french doors to the street below. Beds left something to be desired and you have to contend with a lot of stairs, but overall lovely rooms. The mixed dorm was pretty standard, nice atmosphere. Hostel had computers to use. Linens and towels provided. Nice location, not too loud at night, but still close to everything.
2012-09-07, The rooms were a little bit noisy, but about the rest was OK! I recomend if you want to save money... :-)
2012-08-31, The floor was dirty, the hot water only functioned for some minutes...
2012-09-02, The hostel was in a good location, so close to Dam square and a huge supermarket. The shop proximity was convenient as there was no kitchen in the hostel. Even though it was such a big dorm, there was plenty of space and you met so many people at once it was actually a benefit. The staff were helpful with finding places to visit and the Party Tour in Leidesplein was well worth the money as well!
2012-08-28, The hostel had a bathroom and little kitchen area inside the room but there wasn't really a common area for everyone to meet. The staff were not helpful at all. I had a suitcase and I was on the 5th floor and they would not help me carry it up. The used a lame excuse why they couldn't.
2012-09-04, Note- no kitchen or common room. You are just in your dorm room of 10 or 20 people.Most people who stay were in grops so its harder for solo travelres to make friends. Most come to drink and smoke, so dont be suprised if people come in late at night loud and not caring on whether they bug you or not. Its Amsterdam after all.. For security, theres a guy that chills at the front desk and the front door to the hostel is left open until 4am just fyi.
2012-08-28, Would have been better if the rooms had crates in them as the lockers weren't that big. Other than that I would definitely recommend the hostel.
2012-09-07, Stayed in the 10 bed female only room with 2 other friends for 5 nights, we were behind dam square and right next to the red light district! We were in walking distance of bars, places to eat and all the main attractions like the anne frank haus and van gogh museum! We didn't spend much time in the rooms as we got up, showered and then stayed out until after midnight but the girls we did talk to were from all over the world and were very nice!
2012-09-02, The staff was very nice and helpful. The hostel is located right in the Red Light District which is fun at night. Any location is good in Amsterdam because it's so small, but here there are coffee shops all around, a laundromat close by, and only a 30 minute walk to the Rijksmuseum or van gogh museum.
2012-08-27, Don't bring much luggage because it is up 4 flights of narrow stairs & no lift!
2012-08-21, Lovely hostel with lovely staff! really cool and quirky, perfect location right next to the central station. Very easy to find and great atmosphere.
2012-08-27, There was always a man coming through our 10 woman beddorm- nobody told us about that, which was scary at the first time. There is no kitchen to cook, and no place where to chill out. Also the floor was quite dirty and only one a week they cleaned the bathroom and so on.\r The beds were uncomfortable but the room itself was quiet,luminous and nice.
2012-08-24, We had a bed in the female loft uptairs. The space was great, clean and felt secure.\r The stove was broken and more cooking facilities/a.common room area would have been nice to meet people...\r Overall we enjoyed the stay and the location was really great!
2012-08-27, Excellent location. 5 mins' walk from the main train station. 5 mins' walk to one of the biggest supermarket Albert Heijn. And they have lots of facilities in the room such as refrigerator, microwave, tablewares. But it would be better if the staffs could tell us that there is a man living in the upper stair of the 10-bed-female room, who can enter the female room with his key.
2012-08-14, This hostel is really cool, it has a good vibe and the staff are really nice and helpful. The WiFi works really well, and its a good hostel to make friends. The only downer is that there isint much of a kitchen. But everything else was excellent.
2012-08-16, Friendly helpful staff, fairly clean, very easy and convenient location. Altogether the perfect place if your only really using the bed each night and spending most of your time around the main part of the city.
2012-08-05, Nothing wrong with the place at all, it just didn't have much of an atmosphere. Good walking distance from everything and nice and clean.
2012-08-09, The hostel was supposed to have a kitchen; but when I was there it was not possible to cook. Also, there was just one bathroom for 10 people, so there was always someone in there.
2012-08-01, The hostel was in a good position but it was very noisy, from reception and outside. having toilets and showers directly opposite the reception desk, behind a curtain, was strange.
2012-08-04, Hostel was clean and our ensuite was also clean. Climbing 6 flights of steps was not so fun but those kind of things are unavoidable. Wifi in our room which was great. Not much of an atmosphere as we were in a separate building so didnt really meet anyone else. Good value for money and a good place to crash after exploring Amsterdam. Also easy to find and close to the station.
2012-08-01, it was perfect for my needs but wouldv liked the shower to be attached to the wall.
2012-08-18, good location, very close to the train station but far enough from the red light district that it wasnt sketchy. staff were really nice. not really any common area to hang out. the beds were pretty uncomfortable, mattresses were really thin and you can kind of feel the bar in the bunkbed through them, but if you take advantage of being in amsterdam you wont notice it when you fall asleep anyways.
2012-08-27, We really enjoyed our stay here. We stayed 4 nights, and saw that everything was cleaned throughly and often, the staff were very helpful in the background. The only security was the staff member on recption, as the front door was open all day and late into the night, and doors to the dorms were open most of the day too, although lockers were available. A common room would have been a big hit, as the only place to socialise with others was 2 couches right at reception. Overall, quite happy.
2012-08-03, Everyone was really nice but there was no big lockers or anything to keep you luggage in just small ones to keep important documents in. Wouldn't take anything too nice and would recommend taking a padlock and a pair of flip flops. \r Really good location and staff were really friendly at all hours of the day.
2012-07-27, Loved the 10 bed female dorm, great way to meet fellow travellers and nice to have a room with a balcony. loved that its separate from the main hostel which made it more peaceful.
2012-07-16, Nice hostel. Enjoyed our stay there. Too many stairs tho
2012-07-29, Lıke everywhere else ın Amsterdam thıs place ıs expensıve. It ıs however a good palce to stay ın a good locatıon. No complaınts. Very well equıpped kıtchen.\r We got a prıvate room whıch turned out to be ın a seperate buıldıng across the street, lıke havıng your own apartment.
2012-07-23, There are lots of stairs - very dutch (narrow circular staircase). Once you walk up them once they don't seem so daunting. But its hard with your luggage. The room was lovely and big.
2012-07-18, It was awful, the girl in reception was so aloof and didn't care about the customer. No electricity outlets in the rooms, there is only one outside, uncomfortable bed sheets. When I stayed there the lights went out and they put candles everywhere.
2012-07-09, The only good thing about this place was the location. I wouldnt stay here again. The common room was a couchat reception and there was little to no security. Bathrooms/washrooms were in reception behind a see through sheet.
2012-07-26, i could not of asked for better staff and place to stay !! really enjoyed my time there and will most definitely be going there again !!
2012-07-05, if you are just looking for bed and shower, this is the right place for you, don't expect anything fancy.
2012-07-07, Just a place to sleep. The entire hostel was very underwhelming, the main dorms are right "in" the lobby and the bathrooms are in the lobby as well. Worked very well as a place to just come back and pass out after a long day in the city.
2012-07-14, The location and the fact that it had hot water was about the only good things about this property. Sharing the room with 9 other girls was just fine except the were 10 or 11 other girls in the room sometimes. It was advertised as 10 beds in the dorm ont 12. Also people were smoking in the room when we got there and the whole room stank. The place had low ceilings and big wooden beams in the room can you say fire hazard. The staff should be more vigilant about smoking
2012-07-05, It was way too hot in the rooms at night which made it difficult to sleep and the mattress/pillows were very thin. I didn't have a lot of trouble with the mattress, but my three travel companions complained of back aches the rest of our trip.
2012-07-14, We were especially happy with this hostel as they upgraded us to a private room with no extra charge as they didnt have 2 beds in the same dorm for us to stay in! The staff were very friendly and helpful and when we needed help the guy happilly walked over to our apartment with us to give us a hand. The cleaner came in every morning to clean the kitchen and bathroom, it was definitely worth the price!
2012-06-29, Good hostel to spend the weekend. Nothing more, nothing less.
2012-06-27, You get what you pay for. Its a bed and thats all you really need. Friendly staff and guests.
2012-07-01, The best thing about this hostel was the staff. They were extremely helpful when our bank cards were cancelled in letting us use the phone and giving us pointers. Location is pretty good, easy walk to everything in the city center, with a bit of a walk to the museum district. Reccommend.
2012-06-19, 18 beds in a room. Tends to be noisy at night with everyone coming and going. But it's really cheap, so you can't complain much. Definitely a simple place to stay.
2012-06-30, Very nice large loft style room for the 10-bed room, only bad thing was being on the 4th floor and having to walk up the narrow winding staircase but that is apparently typical in Amsterdam. Very close to the Centraal station, simple to get to from the airport (train goes from airport to Centraal). Short walk to restaurants and bars. Didn't seem to have a communal space to meet other travellers, but had free computers for use. One bathroom for 10 girls is too little but not a huge problem.
2012-06-18, Very good place to stay!!!
2012-06-13, Excellent service and great facilities for the price
2012-06-27, Stayed there for three nights, easy to find from the station, arrived staff were helpful but from arrival didnt hear much from them at all. Rooms very spacious and clean. Just would of liked more advice from the staff on where to go and what to do in the city compared to the 8 other Hostels this was the least helpful, but it wouldn't put me of it still a good hostel.
2012-06-08, I have to admit I was a little bit suspicious when I first saw the hostel..But you should not always trust the first impression! half of our group slept in the mixed room, other half in female dormitory. We were really surprised, when we (the other half) saw our room. It was very cosy and clean and the atmosphere was relaxed. And we had a cute little balcony! :) Thank you!
2012-06-07, The beds are extremely bad. But everything else is very god.
2012-06-19, Our stay at the hostel was ok for what we were paying, we stayed in a 10 bed girls dorm which ended up having 12 girls with 2 mattress on the floor so we were lucky enough to have an actual bed . the beds how ever were very uncomfortable so lucky we were only there for 2 nights. Great location and reasonable clean for a hostel in Amsterdam, we had our own bathroom and kitchen. would of been very disappointe if we had to use the communal bathroom which was located in reception with the kitchen ew
2012-06-30, I didn't really enjoy my stay at this hostel. I didn't really feel safe leaving my belongings in the 20 bed dorm whilst I went out as anyone could just walk in off the street and the door to get into the dorm was often left wide open, even when it was closed, it only needed a simple code to open. The beds were like camp beds, with mine creaking and partially collapsed in the middle. The hostel was also very loud as footsteps could be heard very clearly walking up the stairs to the floor above.
2012-05-23, Standard hostel, little cramped but can't complain bout the price and location.
2012-06-03, Handy location close to central station and very cheap, a proper budget stay. There are 4 toilets, 4 showers and 2 twenty bed dorms. The showers are cramped as is the hostel in general. The staff seemed to do the minimum required with little regard for residents comfort, coming in early in the morning switching on the lights and changing the beds none too quietly. I was woken on my first night by loud music being played in the foyer (directly outside the dorm) at 5am. Free Wifi a saving grace.
2012-05-22, Great location in Amsterdam, just a few minutes walk from the train station.\r The room was great, not the most trustworthy of locks on the door thought. \r The towels were dirty, and no king size sheets, on the king size bed...
2012-04-20, It was in the heart of the city but it had disadvantages..the beds were very uncomfortable and you could feel the iron under the bed..the lights were on all the night and it was very annoying for someone who was sleeping in the upper bed..the room had an awful smell of the shoes..it wasn't worth the 35 euros per night that i paid!!
2012-06-20, Great people, relaxed atmosphere, would definitely reccomend the female dorm for girls as the mixed is a little packed & gross, but I had an great stay! Also beware of the stairs! People with suitcases might prefer another hostel, or just set aside a half hour to lug your suitcase up the stairs upon arrival & departure like I did, I was unaware of the stairs & slightly disappointed that it doesn't mention the lack of elevator etc, but it didn't effect my stay atall.
2012-05-26, The place is cramped and crowded but the location is excellent. The staff puts extra mats on the floor for additional people to sleep on so the number of guests will be more than listed (which is a little unfair). There is only internet in certain areas and the bathrooms are not very clean and also very small. I guess it's the trade-off for a good location which might be worth the steep price if you like convenience.
2012-05-12, The matress are too tiny. We can feel the steel bars of the beds.
2012-05-14, I stayed a week in the 20 bed room. By day 2 I was really wishing I was staying somwhere else. The atmosphere is next to none. People sleep at all hours of the day so it's hard to have a conversation with anyone while still respecting the sleepyheads. The staff are helpful when approached but dont even say hi when you come back. It was a really clean place though, which was the only plus.
2012-06-03, This was my first time staying in a hostel/shared accommodation and I would recommend it for short stays.\r Everything was average, which isn't a bad thing!! the beds were single and pretty standard. They say the provide towels but I would bring one anyway as they are VERY small, although you can manage (i didn't bring a spare towel) Also we went at the beginning of June and it was wet and quite cold so I would bear that in mind when packing PJ's cos the room gets quite cold.
2012-05-09, My friend and I stayed at aivengo at the beginning of may. It was clean and a place to sleep with a roof over your head. The beds didnt all have blankets and when we asked the guy told us people probably took them, so I spent a night with no blankets. We were a couple floors up, the higher you go, you will lose wifi which sort of stucks. If you need somewhere to sleep in Amsterdam, it's cheap and you get just that. Over average experience...
2012-05-04, The staff at this hostel were three friends that were high all the time, therefore not reliable for directions or other questions. The cleaning lady starts loudly cleaning the dorms at 9:00Am-- just when literally 13 girls were trying to get ready for the day. Not to mention, the dorm had one bathroom for 13 girls to share!!! Can you imagine how long it took to get ready in the morning with that wait?! I had been haphazardly assigned to a cot. Not enough lighting to read. Plus MICE. Seriously.
2012-05-04, staff were unfriendly at best, the doors are locked between 4-6am so if you head out for the night, you have to wait around till you can get back in to sleep on a "matress" thats so thin you can feel the metal bar through the back. shower and toilets are in the lobby which, unless your a child or midget are a struggle to fit in. one of the worst places i stayed in while travelling through europe
2012-04-27, The 20 beds room is horriable, mice on the ground.
2012-05-02, the location is good, very close to the train station. but the staff is a little bit cold and absent minded.\r I live on the 5th floor but give me the key of 4th floor, and there is no lift on the building which has a spiral stairs that is difficult to climb.\r the female room is large but the blanket is very thin, making me very cold in the evening! \r the common area is very small, only a sofa beside the reception desk.
2012-04-24, amazing atmosphere and great location. definitely would and will come back when going to amsterdam next time!
2012-04-24, LOL. This is not the Ritz, actually it kind of sucks sleeping there. Only sleep here if you plan on being so ridiculously high that you won't have any issue falling asleep instantly.
2012-05-04, on their website they advertise wifi, and there is no wifi in the rooms, just in the lobby which has space for 3 or 4 people to sit, which is always full. There are mice, which are expected, but they run around the rooms, and eat the food. We stayed in a 12 person female dorm/ensuite and had to share one bathroom between 12 of us, which was not very nice. and for having 6 or 7 floors, there is no elevator, but you can't change the structure of the building so that couldn't really be changed.
2012-03-15, The hostel itself was very close to nearby attractions. They offered a locker for a deposit of 10euros. Only 2 electrically outputs in the main reception though. There is a curfew between the hours of 4-6am. Staff seemed friendly enough and were helpful.
2006-08-10, In the center of the world, with all you need and all you wish. Probably the best hostel I've ever been, I'll return there for sure.
2012-04-30, This hostel was the most fun place I stayed at throughout my stay in Europe, but it was also the worst hostel in terms of facilities. The showers take a while to get warm (they do get warm), and the sheets were just abysmal, although I was lucky enough to bring my own. There is one staff member who lives in the hostel who is an ass, everyone else is fine. Good party hostel, real close to the city center, and I'd recommend this ONLY if you are on a tight budget and want to socialize.. all night
2012-04-21, according to the price, I would say the overall quality is acceptable; if you're looking for cheap place for stay, I would recommend it
2012-05-14, when i were sleeping somethings passed from my bed.. approximately five minutes later again something passed.. After that i get up ad waited what is that ?? And a mouse was walking around my bed... then i went to see the staff.. i told this stuation and he said to me: - yes mouses are general problem at amsterdam.. only that :(((( i changed my bed to upper one :)
2012-04-20, hostel was too expensive for what it offers. the blankets was too thin for cold weather. showers wasnt clean but if u look from another prespective 2 rooms with more then 15 people its hard to make it clean all the time. staff is really nice and tried to keep it clean. kitchen just have a microwave and refrigerator. but location was good. overall hostel is ok if u r staying for shorter time.
2012-04-15, It would be awesome to have somewhat like a community room and thicker bedsheets. I was frozen after night.
2012-04-11, You cannot call a kitchen the fridge and the microwave you have in the always...
2012-04-04, very good.
2012-04-04, The hot water didn't work. The heat in the sleeping rooms appeared not to be working as well. The credit card machine was not working when we tried to pay for our rooms.
2012-04-22, only the location and price is good, if you just want to find a convenient place to sleep for one or two night at a very low price, it's ok.\r the hostel door is always open, which makes me feel insecured. and most of the times, the room door and window is always closed, so the air inside the room is not fresh at all. also, there's only a microwave and a fridge, which means almost impossible to cook. \r but what is above my expectation is that it's not noisy, even in the 20 mixed room.
2012-04-05, The place is small and offers 20 bed dorms, so there are plenty of things that are to be expected with that. There are a lot of travelers and cool people to meet, but also people that stay up talking until 3am in the dorms. The staff is really cool too and are also young travelers that can give good advice. THE MOST ANNOYING THING IS THAT IT IS CLOSED FROM 2-4 AM. We had to wait outside one night and it sucked.
2012-04-15, Considering the price, I think it is a really good hostel. The location is excellent, close to the Central Station and other main attractions. The bathroom is quite clean with a big mirror. The female dorm is big and clean. The bed is comfortable. The staffs are nice and speak perfect English. However, there are a few things that need to be fixed: the blanket is too thin, quite cold at night, no bed sheet, no plug in the bedroom, no proper kitchen, nowhere to hang the clothes in the bathroom
2012-04-26, Was clean but not great facilities to cook which was a little annoying as that is how we like to save money, the dorm we had on the fourth floor was really bright in the morning and my friend had to put her mattress on the floor to be comfortable, since there was a bar under her back. I also didn't like that there was no common area for people to hang out and chill together.
2012-04-04, Don't book this Hostel!! I've ever been to many places in my trips through europe and this is for sure the worst Hostel I booked. \r The policy of this place is an absurd!! \r We arrived there at 22:00 to stay in a dirty room full of people talking and making noise the whole night. The staff is composed by people around 20y old and completely incompetent.
2012-03-29, Not much too complain about. For the money you pay, its good. It can cold during nights though... this needs to be fixed.
2012-03-26, A little cold at night, thin. blankets
2012-03-27, It was a good place to stay for a few nights. Nothing special but it's cheap and clean. The beds were a little uncomfortable but the room was fine overall and the location was good.
2012-04-04, The biggest problem with Aivengo is that they completely turn off the heat at night, and only give beds a single thin blanket. Plus, the staff who run the hostel also live there, so you'll be hearing couples all night. Between the freezing cold and the noise it'll be impossible to sleep. \r \r The communal bathrooms are disgusting, and the setup makes it very easy for things to get stolen, especially considering the front door is left open the majority of the time.
2012-04-03, Aside from the massive hike up to the fifth floor with luggage, the hostel was enjoyable. Staff was friendly and explanatory. They provided you with small towels, which was very nice, and the fridge and microwave in the room came in handy. Relatively clean, but have seen cleaner. Perfect location close to everything.
2012-03-16, Saw mouse in kitchen area and "kitchen area" of microwave/counter right in the bathroom area - appears unsanitary
2012-03-15, it wad loud all night
2012-04-04, If you have a penchant for dirty and questionable rastafarian-type joints, then this is your place. Twenty randomly scattered beds and/or mattresses to a room, each fashioned with half a throw pillow and very thin blanket. I am not even sure how to describe the smell of the place. If you are into having the "experience" and stories that come with the stay, then go for it. If you like minimal comfort and/or cleanliness, then beware.
2012-03-23, Nice hostel totally worth it for a weekend trip for students..\r Good price for Amsterdam with the same characteristics as other more expensive hostels.. \r Be prepared to sleep with 19 other guys/girls and to be maybe woken up at night when soemone enters leaves the room..
2011-11-15, fine, if you don't mind mice in your bedroom...
2012-03-02, The best thing about the hostel is its location - there isn't anything there which's closer to amsterdam centraal. everything else is ok, neither bad nor excellent. in our girls' dorm you couldn't lock the bathroom door, and there was no proper kitchen. Also the blankets are very thin, but at least the linen & towels are included. and it's warm enough inside actually.
2012-02-29, This hostel says "drug-free" then why were there 3 people smoking bongs in the hallway to the lobby.. Location- streets lines with prostitutes in windows. WStaff talking about what drugs to take to parties in the evening.. Not a very nice atmosphere at all, but i guess this is just amsterdam. -Wi-fi doesnt work on 4th floor.
2012-03-08, There are alot of better hostels in Amsterdam. Beds are uncomfortable and pilows are as thin as paper. They promote that the hostel is a drug free environment when people were smoking in the room and just next to the lobby. The showers,although they work well, smell really bad. There is also no place to store your luggage. I would only recommend for people that want an hostel really close to the Centraal Station for an early departure.
2012-02-16, Did not provide shampoo/conditioner as advertised. The Bathrooms smelled.
2012-02-22, noisy, very cold at night... the location is perfect, but the hostel isnt very clean at all.
2012-02-11, I had a really good time and I want to come back soon! :)
2012-02-16, No hit in the room! You have to sleep with your coat on!! The rest was good :-)
2012-02-09, Very nice \r All the portuguese guys liked!!\r Just missed the breakfast, but for the money its ok
2012-01-27, I am so happy about my stay at Aviengo! One of my favourite hostels in Europe! Friendly staff, helpful, good location, we had an amazing room (6th floor without lift hehe). I will go back there when i will go back to Amsterdam :)
2006-03-20, Extremely well located. Very kind staff. Beware of the stairway.
2012-03-02, Good place to stay for a few nights with a group of friends, if you are going to visit the city all day, and only be at the hostel during your sleep. There is no common room, you only have your room The showers are not enough for the number of people using it. The location is very good, you can walk everywhere, day or night. The staff is not very nice and they didn't even bother to put all of my group's beds together. It's cold in the room.\r Anyway, it is a very good option considering the price.
2012-01-26, The only one disadvantage for me was very thin blanket, I was cold during the night
2012-02-10, Our room was huge (directly under the roof) but kinda empty. I was a little bit disappointed that it didn't have the "oriental" look which one can see on the fotos on the Aivengo-homepage. Also the room could've been cleaner (toe nails on the floor and a bit dusty everywhere). The bathroom on the other hand was very nice and modernly furnished. During night time the room got quite draughty. The hostel staff was friendly and my girlfriend could borrow a hair dryer without problems. Hada nice stay
2012-02-23, Had read mixed reviews, however honestly the hostel was perfect for us. We had a private room booked for 4 of us away from the main building and it was brilliant. Right in the middle of the centre, we had a problem on the last day as the people in the room above us over ran the shower and it started leaking through our ceiling! Staff were brilliant though and despite it being quite early were right over to fix it and cleaned up the mess (and all of ours) whilst we were out! Would stay again
2012-01-06, no kitchen: only a microwave machine. this is not good for a several days' stay\r no spoon, no fork
2012-01-26, The hostel was great! Awesome staff allways ready to help in every way they could,the facilites where allways clean and all the people respected each other! The location was great 3/4 blocks away from de wallen and 5 min walk from centraal station!
2011-12-27, The heatint is not powerful enough. It is so cold in the room. But the location is perfect. It takes only 10 minutes to walk to the red light district. And the private 4-person room is quiet!
2012-01-20, The guys working there were all super nice and helpful, there was one woman who worked there who obviously is not enjoying her life but besides her the rest were great!
2012-02-17, This is a great hostel. I stayed there with my girlfriend in a private room with bathroom, everything cool, only inconvenient was to face a 6 floors staircase each time we went in or out, especially with the bags on arrival. \r But the hostel is great, good service, clean, very well located, and close to the central station, which means a lot when you arrive and when you leave.
2011-12-08, You get a really thin blanket, it's preeeetty cold. toilets usually smell like spew. Staff were nice, and did give us one extra blanket when we asked. But i guess for Amsterdam it is cheap..? Oh well, best concentrate on all the DRUGS you can take and not the bed you have to sleep in :)
2011-12-04, Not bright enough in the private room for four. Also the heater was not warm enough!!!!!!! I felt very cold in the room. For other things, they were ok!
2011-12-02, excellent location and staff, but we were really cold at night. other than that, a very cool hostel with character.
2012-01-02, Excellent service, superb customer service, well valued for the price they ask for, very helpful and friendly staff, loved the stay. Before i had visited people had commented there were signs of mice been spotted, however, I FOUND NONE. It's simple if you keep the place clean you won't get mice and it's in the city as well.
2012-01-19, Good Location and helpful staff.\r However there was no heating in our room and very thin covers so I had a very cold night, going to bed fully clothed with my coat as an extra cover wasnt fun!\r I booked a twin room which was on the sixth floor, with very steep narrow winding stairs this was a trek in itself!\r All said, it is basic and a place to lay your head for the night, we rarely spent time in the room, and it is of a great location.
2011-12-02, It was nearly comical how bad this hostel was. Instead of mattresses, there are thinly-stuffed mats that you can feel every bar of the bed through. I would have been more comfortable sleeping on the floor, except that I heard mice scurrying around. The security is laughable. Although there was a lock on the door with a number pad, the code was really obvious. No outlets. Everything about this hostel was perfunctory. It was (barely) a bed to sleep in and nothing more.
2011-11-24, Great location, really nice and helpful staff, clean rooms, and also a big plus with free internet and wifi. \r The beds however, were a bit uncomfortable, and too bad there's no common room, but all in all a perfect hostel for our weekend in Amsterdam.
2011-12-11, The room was fantastic. the only problem I had during my stay in the hostel is that I had a mouce in my room, and when I told the staff about it, they could'nt care less and they did nothing about it, which was dissapointing. other than that the hostel is great and the location is absolutly perfect.
2011-11-25, We had a double room, so didn't really get to spend time in any chill out areas to get a feel for the atmosphere. Everything was clean. The location is off the main strip by 2 blocks, which is nice for sleeping but means you have to walk a bit to get to all the main attractions. We really didn't spend much time other than sleeping in the room, which was fine. I'd recommend it if you want a chill place and expect to be out most of the time. I think it was better than the places where others stay.
2011-11-02, Hostel was alright. I was a bit scared because of the other reviews, but I had no problems here. The location is great (right across from one of the Bulldog cafes) and the hostel is clean enough. No signs of mice or anything like that. Staff was pleasant for the most part.
2011-11-05, Me and a friend stayed in the all-female 10 bedroom dorm. It was nice, bright and spacious with a decent bathroom and a small kitchen area. The beds could have been comfier and the cleaner could have been quieter when she came in at 9am, but all in all a good hostel for the price. And the location is ideal!
2011-10-27, Nice staff. Rooms too noise and need a little renovation
2011-04-21, It was not clean, very not clean. There was 46 peoples sharing two showers and two toilets. People there was nice and it was very well located. For the first day there was no locker for everybody, so we had to leave our bags in the bed for one day.
2011-11-17, I very much enjoyed my stay at Aivengo Hostel. It's VERY CLOSE to Amsterdam Centraal, and across the street is home to one of the famous pubs in Amsterdam, "The Bulldog". I satyed in the 10 bed girls' dorm on the 5th floor. It was quite a walk up the stairs, but it was well worth it,. The room had a refrigerator, a kettle, a microwave, and a private shower and bathroom. Some rooms do not come with these amenities, so check first. The staff was extra helpful and friendly. Amazing view.
2011-11-02, Hostel was great if your on a budget, dont expect much more. The staff where very friendly, no kitchen facilities, just a microwave and kettle. No cutlery etc. There was one guy who worked at the hostel who seemed to be staying in the room too. THe blankets where very thin, especially now its winter, and the guy who worked in the hostel got a comforter???!! go figure.. even he obviously knew how skint the blankets where. Overall good if your on a budget and only staying for a weekend.
2011-10-30, The hostel was okay. It seemed nicer in the pictures. Not too far from the Red Light District. Did not have much of a common area/lobby. Didn't like the fact that the receptionist was always there whether you showered or used the restroom. Overall, it was a good place to stay.
2011-10-26, Atmosphere of the hostel and the rooms were good but there was no hot water in the hostel. And room was a bit cold most probably because the windows weren't closed very well.
2011-10-25, Very friendly and helpful staff. Very clean rooms and bathrooms. Had a problem with getting hot water one night, but other than that everything was perfect! Got free lockers, which was nice. Great atmosphere and location
2011-10-16, it is cheap but with no common area or kitchen so feels very cramped. friendly staff were very helpful
2011-10-21, Great place to go to dorms.. We went to own room and u don't have contact will the dorms people..\r Great staff very polite and allways there to bhelp and advice..\r If you go to the particular room ( no dorms). Be prepare to climb some stairs.. Like all europeans hostels..\r Great location!!!
2011-10-14, Great stay. Had to leave early (while reception was closed) and so wasn't quite sure how to check out. Would be nice to have power cords in the room to charge things in the room. Love the (relative) quiet of the place!
2011-10-12, Great location. Close to everyhing. Very basic hostel, ok for a short stay in Amsterdam. Staff are friendly and very helpful.
2011-10-19, The only really bad thing I can think of is that they only give you a thin blanket (which doesn't get washed) for the night and it was really cold during the night! So bring a sleepingbag!\r The really good thing is the location! It's very easy to get to the place you want to go - you can walk everywhere!\r Otherwise it's quite average! If you're not a really picky backpacker this is a good place to stay 'cause it's so cheap and central!
2011-10-09, This is the best you can get for money you paid!
2011-10-14, It was annoying to go up 5 flights of stairs to get to the room. The stairway smelled bad and it was kinda scary to get up there. The room was very spacious but I was scared to see mice since I was warned that the hostel had some. I never saw any which was good but I was scared the whole 3 days I would see some. The towel that was given to me to use smelled soooooooo bad so take your own towel.
2011-10-06, The best hostel I have ever been to, hands down. Staff is awesome and beds are super comfortable. Miss it already!
2011-10-30, I recommend this hostel. There was everything needed and for 10euro (depozit!-they give it back) you got a small cupboard for your stuff. We were 20 in one room, anyway it was OK. The lights were shut at midnight and if you are really tired you won´t care about the people going in or out.\r And the price is just awesome :)
2011-10-03, Great place!
2011-10-09, What I liked: Nice and clean place. Dorms acted like a common room which made it easy to meet people when everyone is in the room having drinks. Showers and toilets were basic but fine enough. Hostel is close to the red light district and to plenty of coffee shops.\r What I didn't like: The staff turned on the lights at 9am which always woke everyone up - no sleeping in. The kitchen was a joke, just a microwave and fridge. On that point, the fridge was too small for the amount of people staying.
2011-09-23, it is a good place to stay if you do not have any other option.
2011-10-05, MUCH smaller than it seems from the pictures, no lounge area at all so I barely got to meet anyone, creaky bed, stinky bathrooms, mice in my room. But it was pretty safe, lots of locks, and the location was perfect.
2011-10-06, I stayed there for 3 nights and had a blast. The staff were very helpful and nice and the rooms and bathrooms were relatively clean. The location was awesome! We were right in the heart of Amsterdam, but still in a quiet area. My only complaint was that there were mice. If you do stay here (which I recommend you do) try to keep food and personal items up high on your bed or in one of their lockers.
2011-09-17, security was lax, easy code to hack to get into the room. Clean, had nice staff, very welcoming and open.
2011-10-14, it was damn cold! and they didnt have any extra blankets;/ so i advice you to bring your own;]
2011-09-14, Awesome place. Only complaint was a rat that ate my snack. But other than that, it's awesome.
2011-09-11, This is a very small hostel with excellent location. It's 5minutes walk to damm square which is amazing. Stil it doesnt have enough showers and toilets. price is very good for a city like Amsterdam. So if you are poor and dont care about facility and only interested in amsterdam this place is best for you
2011-09-23, The room smelt very bad. You get what you pay for though. It was good that they had wifi and two computers, it made it easy for me to get in touch with my buddies. The hostel is in a great location. The red light district is only two blocks away. The showers are gross so I recommend bringing sandals. I rented a locker, but barely used it I felt as if my stuff was sort of safe in there. Overall the hostel wasn't that bad, if you are on a budget and don't mind where you sleep, this is fine
2012-03-21, for us it was a different experience to stay in a boat, it's very close to the center, the rooms are small but .. hey it's a boat.. i would sure recommend it!
2011-09-07, Hostel is very centrally located to both the train station and the red light district. Room was HUGE but had 22 beds in it so people coming and going at all hours of the day. Room and hostel doors are open from 9am till 9pm. Anyone can walk in off the street and into the rooms. Felt very unsecure leaving my belongingsd in this hostel. Lockers are provided though. No real kitchen facilities and not many bathrooms. Most likely would not stay here again.
2011-09-15, Was a bit worried as a lot of reviews before said about a mouse problem. We didnt see any in the 4 days we were there, the rooms were all clean and the toilets/bathrooms were fine, plus room lockers were provided free of charge (just a £10 deposit for the keys). The worst part was the stairs, being up on the top floor was a bitch coming back home in the evening. And the highlight was definitely the showers!
